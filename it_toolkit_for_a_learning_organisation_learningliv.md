# IT Toolkit for a Learning Organisation #LearningLive {#it-toolkit-for-a-learning-organisation-learninglive}

_Date posted: 2 August 2011_

I'll be running a workshop at this year's [Learning Live](http://conference.screencastacademy.com/) conference in September (13th & 14th in Birmingham if you're interested!) During the workshop, I'll be focussing on key processes such as:

*   Maintaining effective customer and supplier relationships
*   Managing face-to-face and online delivery of formal events
*   Forecasting and monitoring revenue and costs
*   Providing learners with access to up-to-date resources
*   Supporting informal learning

But, when choosing any IT system to support your business, you need to consider at least the following three questions alongside your functional requirements:

1.  Do you need the system to be able to cope with inputs from multiple users, or just from single, unconnected users?
2.  If server-based, do you need the system to be hosted inside or outside of your organisation's firewall?
3.  Would you prefer to go for a multi-functional tool, or a set of best-of-breed tools?

I'll be asking the participants at the workshop to discuss the advantages of each of these approaches. So, this is a heads-up to any people planning on attending to get your thinking hats on ;-) Of course, if you want to think in advance, please feel free to comment below. [I've discovered that the commenting engine on the Learning Conversations site doesn't like people posting comments within two hours of each other! Until I get that fixed - if you get an error when commenting, please try again a little while later.]
