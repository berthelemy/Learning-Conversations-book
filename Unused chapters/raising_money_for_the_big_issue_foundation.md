If you weren't aware of this already, later this year I shall be doing a 230 mile bike ride from London to Paris in aid of the [Big Issue Foundation](http://www.bigissue.com/) (an established UK-based organisation that helps homeless people to get back on their feet).

Thanks to the people at [Excel Everest](http://www.exceleverest.com/) and [Onlignment](http://onlignment.com/), I'm already over 20% of the way towards my target.

If you are a company in the learning technology / training / education field, I will happily put your logo and a link on my blog sidebar in return for a donation (�100 is suggested, but I'll accept less!) - Please see the small print though.

If you donate more than �100, I'll write an independent review.

If you are an individual and wish to donate, please let me know how I can help you in return.

### Small print {#small-print}

This blog (according to my software's hit counter) gets about 800 direct browser hits per day. Although that has gone up to 5000 when a post gets picked up by the L&D community.

I will reserve the right to choose whether or not an advert or review is appropriate. Basically, I'll include anyone if your product is legal, honest and decent, and you're selling to any of the following sectors:

*   Adult learning
*   Workplace learning
*   Organisational development
*   Internal communication

If you're not sure whether you fit the readership of this blog, then contact me first.

Reviews will be independent and honest. They may contain criticisms and ideas for improvement. You will have the opportunity to respond before the review is published.

Reviews that are written as part of this scheme will include the Big Issue Bike Ride logo.

Adverts placed on this site do not indicate that the owner of this site is recommending the products.

I will take none of the monies raised - although, it must be said, that some of it is paying the costs of putting on the Bike Ride.

### About the Big Issue Foundation {#about-the-big-issue-foundation}

The Big Issue Foundation is dedicated to the well being of Big Issue Vendors, working with over 2900 individuals across the UK. Their skilled staff work one to one with vendors, tackling issues ranging from health and accommodation through to money management and aspirations.

The Big Issue Foundation is about taking control, moving forward, gaining independence and rebuilding lives. They exist to enable vendors to continue on their journey away from homelessness.

Did you know that life expectancy on the streets is only 46 years old?

You can help support me, and The Big Issue Foundation, by making a [secure online donation](http://my.artezglobal.com/personalPage.aspx?SID=310589&Lang=en-CA) using your credit card at my fundraising page.
