Well - it's live... Wyver Solutions Ltd is now official and up & running. What a learning curve: company registration, corporation tax, payroll, book-keeping, company resolutions, invoices, working out what accountants mean by credit & debit... If anyone's interested in how I'm looking to spend the time when I'm not working for my main employer then take a look. It's all very sparse at the moment, but will give you an idea. And if there's anything I can help you with please get in touch. If there's going to be a conflict of interest with my main employer I'll let you know :-)
