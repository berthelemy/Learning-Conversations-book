# Email merge from Word {#email-merge-from-word}

_Date posted: 4 July 2007_

I learnt today that it's not possible to do an email merge from Word to Outlook unless they are both the same version. I got the [answer](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA011464811033.aspx) eventually from MS. You don't get an error message - just nothing gets put in your Outbox.
