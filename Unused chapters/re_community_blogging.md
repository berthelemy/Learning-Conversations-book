Another one of Stephen Downes' fascinating looks at the world as it should be.

> So anyhow I have been stranded by the weather for the second time in as many weeks, this time thanks to a snowstorm in Toronto. I'm on my way home from Northern Voice where I delivered this talk, an analysis of community as it emerges in blogging: how it is formed, how it should reshape the blogosphere, and how it can be implemented (quite easily) technologically. And along the way, deflating a few pet concepts of the blogerati, such as the value of the long tail and the utility of tagging. [Slides](http://www.downes.ca/files/CommunityBlogging.ppt) are also available (about 9 mB). (mpeg) By Stephen Downes, Stephen's Web, February 19, 2005
