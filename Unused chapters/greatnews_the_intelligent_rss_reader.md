I did use [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) a lot, but then found myself doing much more travelling and so not able to read stuff online. So I moved everything over to [RSS Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/), which works well, but was incredibly slow at loading up and seemed to eat memory by the bucketload. But now, I've found the best of both worlds; an offline RSS reader that sychronizes with Bloglines. It's called "[GreatNews](http://www.curiostudio.com/)". It's a tiny download, fires up immediately, and has all the features of RSS Bandit that I used, but more (for example, instead of fixed "flags" to put against items, I can create user-defined "labels" to pull things together into groups that I want to come back to. And an item can have more than one label. Ideal for bringing stuff together for a research project. So RSS Bandit has gone, and I can use Bloglines again. And stay organised!
