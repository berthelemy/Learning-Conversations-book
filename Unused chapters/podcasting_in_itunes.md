# Podcasting in iTunes {#podcasting-in-itunes}

I really must get ELGG working on a site somewhere. Trouble is I'm quite wedded to my b2evolution blog and migrating everything across will be a nightmare. Unless anyone can tell me otherwise?

Elgg is, of course, a perfect podcasting platform; upload MP3 files to your file repository, tag them with a common keyword (eg "podcast") and the RSS feed for that tag is your podcast feed. We've tested the system with all major podcasting software, although the proof will obviously be in the pudding; perhaps one of us needs to actually start a podcast here.
