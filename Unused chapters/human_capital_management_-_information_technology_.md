This site looks like it might be quite useful. It looks at using technology to support all parts of Human Capital Management, coming very much from the business perspective. The sections on LMS's & LCMS's are pretty detailed. They tend to focus on Enterprise systems... ie. those that cost a lot. But there's some good stuff here.
