# Blogs in Plain English {#blogs-in-plain-english}

_Date posted: 3 December 2007_

I've not been doing much thinking out loud on the blog recently - due to pressure of work. But I couldn't resist making a note of this video. It's another one from the [CommonCraft Show](http://www.commoncraft.com/show). This time it's about blogs in general. Whereas I tend to focus on how blogs can stimulate reflection and learning communities, this video takes it from the point of view of building communities of practice around particular topics. Both are entirely valid. Just different facets of the same thing. [youtube]NN2I1pWXjXI[/youtube]
