# Response to Stephen Downes: Organisational Learning model {#response-to-stephen-downes-organisational-learning-model}

_Date posted: 24 September 2007_

I'm having real problems posting comments on people's sites recently. Today it's Stephen Downes' site that won't let me... Anyway, Stephen made a [comment](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=41795) about the [diagram I posted yesterday](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/09/24/organisational_learning_today_concept_ma). Here's what I wanted to add to his post: Hi Stephen, Yes, perhaps "Organisational Learning" is a misnomer - but it is very definitely about how organisations can support learning. Part of that is developing a culture that is supportive & expects learning. Part of that is in the performance management systems (not sure where you got "performance standards" from). I disagree totally that we should call it "managed learning". Just because it's coming from a corporate perspective doesn't mean that the corporation should manage learning. Instead the organisation should be looking at how to provide a direction for learning, and, at the same time, support the individual learning needs of the people in the organisation.
