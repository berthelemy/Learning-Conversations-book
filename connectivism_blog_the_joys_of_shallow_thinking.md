Struggling to read hundreds of emails and blog posts a day? [George Siemens](http://www.connectivism.ca/blog/42#comments) is too. But he sees a real benefit in it - it gives you the big picture. Another illustration I've heard is that it's like surfing... (so I've been told) You keep scanning the waves as they come in until you catch one that you can ride - that's where the deep thinking will come. Multiple metaphors - what joy!
