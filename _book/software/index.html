<h1 id="to-open-source-or-not">To open source or not? </h1>
<p><em>Date posted: 20 January 2009</em></p>
<p><em>This is a high-level summary of a talk I&apos;m giving at Learning Technologies 2009 at the end of this month. If you&apos;re coming along then use it to help you prepare some questions...</em> Open source learning software means more than just <a href="http://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a>. As well as the ubiquitous LMS, there are open source content development tools (e.g. <a href="http://exelearning.org/" target="_blank">ExeLearning</a>), mind-mapping applications (e.g. <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Freemind</a>), audio-editing tools (eg. <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>), utilities (e.g. <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">Filezilla</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>), content management systems (e.g. <a href="http://www.etomite.org/" target="_blank">Etomite</a> and <a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a>), and even <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a>, a full-blown competitor to Microsoft Office. All of these, and many other open-source applications, are potentially useful for learning professionals - but how do you know that these open-source applications are going to work in your organisation?</p>
<h3 id="the-software-procurement-rulebook">The software procurement rulebook </h3>
<p>Rule 1: Will it do what you want it to do? Rule 2: Will it fit? Rule 3: Work out what it will cost Rule 4: Will I be able to get help? Rule 5: Is it sustainable?</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-will-it-do-what-you-want-it-to-do">Rule 1: Will it do what you want it to do? </h3>
<p>That should be the easiest thing to work out. You come up with a set of requirements and the application vendor lets you know which of those things it will do. Of course, life&#xFFFD;s never as simple as that. I&#xFFFD;ve seen far too many requirements that focus entirely on a list of functionality, with no regard for how that functionality is actually implemented within the software. So you could end up with a tool that will do everything you want it to, but no-one will be able to use it. There are three approaches to finding out whether software will actually do what you need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find someone who knows the software who can look at your requirements and explain how the tool will work in your context</li>
<li>Read up all the product documentation that is available</li>
<li>Try it out on a small scale</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-open-source-advantage">The open-source advantage </h4>
<p>With closed-source software you are usually tied to the vendor to get information about the product. Some vendors are excellent at providing information and demonstration versions to look at. Many are less so. Many vendors are happy to send a salesperson to see you - but usually they are biased towards the product. With open-source software you&apos;ll may need to pay a consultant if you want someone to demonstrate the software and understand your requirements (particularly with a complex application). But at least you are more likely to get an independent view on things. Also, with open-source software, there is nothing to stop you taking it and trying it out on any scale. Although you must remember that the more people are using it, and the more you rely on it, the more likely it is that you&apos;ll need professional help to use it well. That does depend very much on the type of application though.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-will-it-fit">Rule 2: Will it fit? </h3>
<p>What existing systems will the new software need to work with? Will it work on your servers? Will you need additional server expertise or hardware? Where will you get that from? Will it need to look like existing systems? Who will do that? Will it need to collect data from your existing systems? Can your existing systems provide the data in a compatible format? Will it need to supply data to your existing systems? Can it do that already, or will you need additional coding?</p>
<h4 id="the-open-source-advantage">The open source advantage </h4>
<p>In general, the major open source projects try to follow recognised standards and practices in coding and in linking to other applications. There&apos;s no advantage to keeping data inside your particular application; strength is gained by the number of ways you can connect to other development teams and applications.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-work-out-what-it-will-cost">Rule 3: Work out what it will cost </h3>
<p>Not just the license for using it, but in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>IT infrastructure - servers, bandwidth, faster machines to run it on</li>
<li>installation - on a server or on every person&#xFFFD;s desktop</li>
<li>configuration - making sure it fits the way your organisation works, and looks the way you want it to look</li>
<li>training requirements - for administrators, IT technical staff and for general users</li>
<li>support and maintenance - making sure that the software keeps running and is updated frequently</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, as more people begin to rely on the software, the more time and resource you need to use in deploying it.</p>
<h4 id="the-open-source-advantage">The open source advantage </h4>
<p>With open-source software you don&apos;t need to invest vast amounts in the first instance. You can start small and scale up as required.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-will-i-be-able-to-get-help">Rule 4: Will I be able to get help? </h3>
<p>The best software companies (in my opinion) support their users in a completely open environment. This isn&#xFFFD;t just true for open-source solutions. Examples in the closed-source world include Mindjet&#xFFFD;s MindManager and Articulate. I have bought both of those products, partly on the strength of their customer support. They will often provide online Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), alongside manuals and examples of good practice. Even better is when they open up online forums where users can ask questions which are then answered by both in-house and third-party experts. If the software supplier themselves do not provide support, are there third-party organisations that will?</p>
<h4 id="the-open-source-advantage">The open source advantage </h4>
<p>Because the source-code is open, it means that anyone can have an in-depth understanding of the software. For the popular projects this usually means that you will have a range of options for getting support - from the software developers themselves, or from consultancies, training organisations and other service providers.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-is-it-sustainable">Rule 5: Is it sustainable? </h3>
<p>It&apos;s all about the money - how will you be reasonably sure that development will continue? With closed-source software it&apos;s usually quite easy to determine how the software development is funded. Funding models for open-source development vary widely. But you need to make sure it&#xFFFD;s going to happen somehow. Information Week has identified <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/01/the_five_open_s.html" target="_blank">five open-source business models</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell support services</li>
<li>Build (or run) hardware that uses your software</li>
<li>Sell proprietary (closed-source) software that complements the open-source code</li>
<li>Sell closed-source licenses for customers who prefer not to be bound by the open-source license conditions</li>
<li>Sell advertising space</li>
</ul>
<p>The most popular model by far is that of selling services. Usually it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial code is created by a core team for their own purposes - often using chunks of code from other open-source projects</li>
<li>The code is released as open-source and other people start to use it - often feeding back bugs, ideas, or additional bits of code - the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot;</li>
<li>Larger users may set up their own development teams to work with the code - these usually feed code back into the Core team.</li>
<li>Experts in the software (including the Core team) may offer services such as consultancy, hosting, customisation or configuration</li>
<li>Sometimes the Core team may have formal accreditation arrangements with service providers which means the Core get a share of any revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more popular an application, often the more formalised the development and accreditation processes become - such is the case with Moodle. If there is no apparent business model for an application, then it may be that it&#xFFFD;s being developed by enthusiasts, who want to make use of the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; effect inherent in open-source development. If you want to be reasonably certain that development will continue, then you need to play a part in the ecology. That might mean purchasing services from organisations that feed into the development cycle. Or it might mean contributing towards the development cycle yourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing chunks of code</li>
<li>Testing pre-release versions</li>
<li>Supporting other users in the forums</li>
<li>Producing documentation</li>
<li>Feeding back on bugs and issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you know that Microsoft themselves funded the part of Moodle that enables it to connect it with Microsoft&#xFFFD;s SQL Server, Oracle &amp; other databases out of the box? (Source: Moodle.org)</p>
<h4 id="the-open-source-advantage">The open source advantage </h4>
<p>Open-source software has a complex set of business models - which don&apos;t always sit comfortably alongside more a commercial cash-based economy. However it does mean that you can contribute to the ecology without necessarily having lots of cash.</p>
<h2 id="a-first-look-at-moodle-2">A first look at Moodle 2 </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 12 January 2011</em></p>
<p>I&apos;ve been using <a href="http://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle 2.0</a> in anger for a few months now, and thought it was time to put down a few thoughts about how it differs from Moodle 1.x. At the moment, I would say I&apos;m only scratching the surface of Moodle 2&apos;s functionality. There&apos;s a lot of behind-the-scenes changes that I&apos;m just not touching at all (eg. the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_2.0_release_notes#For_developers:_API_changes" target="_blank">new API&apos;s</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API = Application Programming Interface</a>) So, this is just an initial look at some of the things that have jumped out as I&apos;ve used it.</p>
<h3 id="conditional-activities">Conditional Activities </h3>
<p>In Moodle 1.x it was possible to set up conditional activities only with quite a major hack to the code. In Moodle 2.0 it&apos;s built in, and works extremely well. This was why I chose to use Moodle 2.0 for a project I&apos;m working on. It&apos;s allowed us to create an assignment, and then show a suggested answer to that assignment only once the tutor has given a mark. That&apos;s what Conditional Activities do - they allow course designers to set up quite sophisticated pathways that only open up once certain conditions have been met. How you use them will depend very much on your learning philosphy - particularly your belief as to how much control a learner should have over their own lesson. If you&apos;re one of <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/does-president-obama-support-locking-your-e-learning-course-navigation/" target="_blank">those people who won&apos;t even let a learner turn over the page until they completed an activity on that page</a> then you&apos;ll have a field day with this new functionality. If you&apos;re more like me, and prefer to provide a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding" target="_blank">scaffolded learner experience</a> with free access to resources, then you&apos;ll want to use this with care.</p>
<h3 id="management-menus">Management menus </h3>
<p>Now, I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s just because I&apos;ve grown up with Moodle (since version 1.0!) but there are some bits of the new interface it&apos;s taking a little while to get used to. I quite liked the Update this Activity button at the top right. It was always there, and easy to get to. Similarly, when I&apos;m supporting users I often used the Login As button on their profile. It was in a sensible place, at the bottom of their profile. Now the interface consists of an administration menu block that changes depending on where you are in the site. This has several advantages, but some key disadvantages:</p>
<h4 id="advantages">Advantages </h4>
<ul>
<li>It allows more functionality to be exposed immediately to the user</li>
<li>It&apos;s in a consistent place, and behaves in a consistent way</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages </h4>
<ul>
<li>If you&apos;ve got more than a couple of blocks on the page, this administration block disappears off the bottom of the page very quickly. That means the user has to scroll immediately just to get to core functions.</li>
<li>The interface is now separated from the functions it&apos;s controlling. It&apos;s only a minor change, but has a significant impact</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-packs">Theme packs </h3>
<p>There are some major changes to the ways theme packs are designed (See post: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/11/03/creating-a-new-theme-for-moodle-2?blog=5" target="_blank">Creating a Moodle 2.0 theme</a>). It means that your Moodle 1.9 themes will need a complete rework. Having said that, it didn&apos;t take long to get the hang of how the new CSS structures work. The only thing I wasn&apos;t able to do is remove the &quot;Show topic&quot; buttons from the course page. This was always <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/11/27/working-with-moodle-themes?blog=5" target="_blank">the first thing I did in Moodle 1.x</a>, as, in my experience, that one part of the interface causes great problems for users. The new theming structure should mean we&apos;ll get a lot more good-looking Moodle sites. With Moodle 1.x you could see a Moodle site from miles away. I&apos;m looking forward to coming across a site and not knowing it&apos;s Moodle...</p>
<h3 id="course-files-interface">Course files interface </h3>
<p>I know there&apos;s been a lot of discussion about this already, but this is one part of Moodle where I think the interface has lost out to functionality. When I first came across Moodle I was responsible for another online learning system that we were selling into schools. As part of my work, I spent three days with each school, helping them get to grips with the system and working through the implications of online learning on school structures and practices. At least, that was the theory. In practice, much of the time was spent walking the teachers through the convoluted process of getting files onto the server, and then building a link to those files. Moodle was a breath of fresh air. The workflow had obviously been designed by real people. You started out by saying you wanted to add a Resource to a course, and then Moodle took you through a carefully crafted process to add the resource and upload the file(s). For those who wanted to be a bit more advanced, it was possible to upload a zip file of resources, and then, after unzipping, use those files for other course resources. The only problem with the Moodle 1.x approach was that of reusability. Each course would need its own copy of the files it needed. Let&apos;s say there was a standard document that needed to go into each course, it would need a separate copy in each course file store. This led to a few difficulties. If that document needed to change, then it would have to be reuploaded many times. No problem if you&apos;ve got a small Moodle site. But for large sites, or sites with large files, it became quite a headache. For many the answer was to leave Moodle&apos;s basic, but friendly, content-management functions, and implement repositories (like <a href="http://www.giuntilabs.com/en/products/harvestroad-hive-digital-repository" target="_blank">HarvestRoad Hive</a>) that sat underneath Moodle. These are great systems, but often quite complex and expensive. Moodle 2.0 has adopted a different approach to managing content. For the details of it, take a look at Moodle Docs. Basically, it allows files to be used more than once; across multiple courses. But, in doing so, the workflow for basic use has become considerably more complex. Course designers/teachers now have to make many more choices when working through the process - with a corresponding increase in the confusion that can result. The underlying model is far less easy to comprehend and explain than the old course files store. Which, for people without an IT background, can be quite a barrier to use. Also, there now appears to be no way of uploading a batch of files in one zip file, and then picking from those files for a number of resources. (Please tell me if that&apos;s not true!) I haven&apos;t got an answer to the zip file problem, but my solution to the complex interface would be to, by default, only give users a basic &quot;upload files&quot; interface, with the option to switch on &quot;advanced file management&quot; as they gain in confidence.</p>
<h3 id="book-module">Book Module </h3>
<p>This was always one of the first additional modules I put into my Moodle 1.x sites. It provided a way of creating a set of HTML pages very quickly. No, it wasn&apos;t particularly pretty, and didn&apos;t do anything fancy (like annotations or comments) from a learning perspective. But it was useful. I&apos;d hoped this would be incorporated into a new multi-page HTML resource-type in Moodle 2.0, but that hasn&apos;t yet appeared, and there&apos;s no news yet on when the Book module will be ported across to Moodle 2.x. I know this is a major blocker for many organisations who would otherwise upgrade their Moodle sites. Let&apos;s hope it gets sorted soon.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions </h3>
<p>Moodle 2.0 has been a long time coming. There&apos;s a lot that has changed under the bonnet (hood), but these are invisible to most people. Those who were hoping for more of a web 2.0 design and user interface will be quite disappointed. There&apos;s a lot of work to be done to make the (admin) interface compare with tools like <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://b2evolution.net/" target="_blank">b2evolution</a> and <a href="http://www.kashflow.co.uk/default_b.asp" target="_blank">Kashflow</a>. For people who have now grown up with Amazon, Google and Ebay, these factors are critical to encourage organisation-wide adoption. If we&apos;re not careful, Moodle will become loved by the techies and senior management, but will lose its core fanbase - the teachers and course designers who fell for Moodle&apos;s simplicity and ease of use. It&apos;s a fine balance to keep; help those who pay the bills, whilst, at the same time, help those who will champion the system in their organisations. I&apos;m hoping that Moodle 2.0 will be the start of some major improvements to bring Moodle into this decade. It&apos;s still an extremely flexible platform for tutor-led learning interventions, and certainly one I&apos;d still recommend any organisation consider to support teaching or training.</p>
