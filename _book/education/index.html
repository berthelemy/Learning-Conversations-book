<h2 id="bill-gates-high-schools-are-obsolete">Bill Gates: High Schools are obsolete </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 10 November 2007</em></p>
<p>From Learning Trends 312: 1. Bill Gates Says High Schools Are &quot;Obsolete&quot;: Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft recently gave an incredibly powerful speech about the shortcomings and challenges of United States high schools. Here are a few of his key points and worries: <em> &quot;By obsolete, I don&apos;t just mean that our high schools are broken, flawed and under-funded - though a case could be made for everyone of those points. By obsolete, I mean that our high schools - even when they are working as designed - cannot teach our kids what they need to know today.&quot; </em> &quot;Training the workforce of tomorrow with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about today&apos;s computers on a 50 year old mainframe.&quot; <em> &quot;Only 1/3 of our students graduate from high school ready for college, work and citizenship.&quot; </em> Gates suggests 3 new &quot;R&quot;&apos;s for redesigned high schools: Rigor, Relevance and Relationships (with mentoring adults). * Gates is urging, and backing these perspectives with grants from his foundation of $1 Billion, focusing on smaller schools, different forms of measurement and greater commitment to getting ALL students across the finish line in terms of readiness for college, work and citizenship. It is worth reading the full text: <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/MediaCenter/Speeches/BillgSpeeches/BGSpeechNGA-050226.htm" target="_blank">http://www.gatesfoundation.org/MediaCenter/Speeches/BillgSpeeches/BGSpeechNGA-050226.htm</a></p>
<h2 id="can-you-change-an-organisation-from-the-inside">Can you change an organisation from the inside? </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 12 July 2010</em></p>
<p>Lot&apos;s of things are coming together for me at the moment. This post is an attempt to try to mash them together and see what comes out... 1) I&apos;m reading the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/" target="_blank">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. If there was ever a book that says what I&apos;ve been thinking - this is it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people in today&apos;s world seem to assume that official authorisation is required to learn new things</p>
<p>At some point you&apos;ve got to break down and trust people both inside and outside your organisation.</p>
<p>Does your organisation have any genuine passion to share? Can you deal with such honesty?</p>
<p>Organisations don&apos;t know who their customers are any more.</p>
<p>The Net is next to impossible to understand unless you&apos;ve experienced it for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could go on, but I&apos;d probably end up quoting from every page... 2) Through Twitter interactions with <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyparkin" target="_blank">Tony Parkin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dajbelshaw" target="_blank">Doug Belshaw</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/eylanezekiel" target="_blank">Eylan Ezekiel</a> and a host of other people who have been pushing the boundaries for years, I&apos;m re-engaging with my passion for schools and teaching. We&apos;ve been saying for years that networks fundamentally change the dynamic of education. That classroom walls can be broken down, that learning is a wider process than that of knowledge transfer from teacher to student. Yet, with all the thinking and fantastic practice that is going on, we still haven&apos;t really changed the underlying organisational structures that our schools are based on. I&apos;m not saying throw out the baby with the bathwater. But the trouble is, there just isn&apos;t the critical mass of networked people in each institution. <strong>What would happen if they all got together to create a new way of doing education?</strong> 3) A similar situation is happening in corporate learning. There are individuals within L&amp;D teams across the country (and the world) who are connecting, learning how to learn and trying to demonstrate how training has to change not just just to keep up with society but to make training better. <strong>What would happen if they got together to create a new way of doing corporate L&amp;D?</strong> 4) We keep having conferences. <a href="http://www.teachmeet.org.uk/" target="_blank">Teachmeets</a> are becoming some of the most valuable CPD events for teachers. Yet very little real change is happening at a structural level. 5) We have a choice. We either stay inside the current structures and try to change them from the inside or we leave them. 6) Let&apos;s assume, for the moment, that leaving is not an option, so how do we change the current structures? We have to play the game. Use the accepted methods to communicate and make change happen. That means engaging with the regular media and lobbying government (or the management). 7) So here&apos;s a proposal. I&apos;m focussing on schools for now:</p>
<h3 id="education-policy-conference">Education policy conference </h3>
<p>(Thanks to Eylan for his significant input on this) <strong>Purpose</strong>: To look at education in its widest sense and propose recommendations for government. <strong>Participants</strong>: A mix of &apos;stakeholders&apos; (eg. teachers, policy-makers, industry leaders, parents, techies, kids!) <strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the ground with a series of prompt statements (see below) - publicised widely and discussed in various media spaces.</li>
<li>Raise the issues of assessment, curriculum, the place of school in society and the home, infrastructure and ethos.</li>
<li>Participants to contribute to a conference wiki under those headings.</li>
<li>Participants to come prepared to a day&apos;s conference to discuss, agree, and map out a 5 year plan towards creating a 21st century education system.</li>
<li>The final statement must have three aspects &#xFFFD; it must be written for a policy audience, must show stages of development, and must be simple to sum up.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prompt-statements">Prompt statements </h3>
<ul>
<li>The National Curriculum should stay But Ofsted should go</li>
<li>Testing must be rigorous but results should not be published</li>
<li>Schools have a moral and societal obligation to help shape children&apos;s lives to be healthy and respectful of authority</li>
<li>If teachers choose resources / suppliers then those choices should be accountable to the community</li>
<li>Classrooms should only be used when absolutely necessary</li>
<li>The government should appoint <a href="http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2010/06/a-nice-for-education-by-karen-whitby/" target="_blank">a Chief Education Officer, and an independent advisory board on education</a></li>
<li>The Open University is a model of highly effective, scalable education that <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/06/ou-key-to-future-of-he.html" target="_blank">could be replicated across schools and universities nationwide</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what do you think? Could this work? Would it make <strong>any</strong> difference? Only if it had a high enough profile.</p>
<h2 id="6-reasons-not-to-maintain-a-school-service-during-closure-days">7 reasons not to maintain a school service during closure days </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 7 January 2011</em></p>
<p>Both my children&apos;s schools were closed for over three days last week due to snow. It was definitely right to close the buildings, but no explanation came from the schools as to why all teaching and learning activity also had to stop. Both schools have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_platform" target="_blank">learning platforms</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment" target="_blank">VLEs</a>). In my view, a school that has embedded usage of these tools in their day to day activity should not need to stop work when the buildings are closed. But here are 7 reasons for schools who don&apos;t want to use technology to maintain a service during closure days:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&apos;s too different to how we normally operate, so the students won&apos;t be able to handle it.[My response: Why aren&apos;t you using these tools to support your normal work?]</li>
<li>Our teachers are not confident in the use of these tools.[My response: Why not?]</li>
<li>Some of the students do not have internet access.[My response: OK. So how are you going to plan ahead so that these students can have access - whether at friends or elsewhere?]</li>
<li>Some of the teachers do not have internet access.[My response: How can a teacher be effective these days without it? How are you going to plan ahead so they can get access when it&apos;s needed?]</li>
<li>We don&apos;t have a Learning Platform.[My response: You don&apos;t need one. Just start by using the masses of free tools listed on <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html" target="_blank">Jane Hart&apos;s C4LPT website</a>. Or sign-up for <a href="http://www.google.com/educators/p_apps.html" target="_blank">Google Apps for Educators</a> (also free). When you have worked out what you really need a Learning Platform to do, then you can start to think about buying one to meet your specific needs.]</li>
<li>The students wouldn&apos;t do the work anyway.[My response: What are your expectations of the students? What incentives do you already use as part of classroom management? What support do teachers get from Senior Management in handling unwilling learners? Why can&apos;t you extend those strategies to online work as well?]</li>
<li>It&apos;s extra work for the teachers to produce all the resources required.[My response: Yes, maybe. But there are real, practical benefits to teaching and learning online that will balance it out, such as: automated marking, deeper and broader learning, opportunity for less confident learners to contribute etc (See the <a href="http://www.eep-edu.org/InnService/Start/what_addval_start.htm" target="_blank">European Education Partnership for more</a>)]</li>
</ol>
<p>What reasons did your school give for not maintaining a service last week? What are their strategies in the case of a long term closure (such as with a flu epidemic)? Are these really practical if they&apos;re not already putting those strategies in practice on a day-to-day basis? For more, see the Naace press release on &quot;<a href="http://www.naace.co.uk/twokindsofschool" target="_blank">Two kinds of school</a>&quot; [Update] Northern Echo news report: <a href="http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8721526.Stranded_students_log_on_from_home_via_web/" target="_blank">Stranded students log on from home</a>. What a shame this is still newsworthy!</p>
<h2 id="a-chartered-institute-for-teaching">A Chartered Institute for Teaching? </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 18 January 2011</em></p>
<p>In the last week, I&apos;ve spent a fair bit of time talking with colleagues from the education sector.</p>
<p>One of the topics of discussion was teacher professional development, and how we might encourage teachers to take more responsibility for their own learning.</p>
<p>I would contend that any profession worth that name will have continuing professional development at its core. It will be a requirement for remaining a member of that profession.</p>
<p>Not so with teaching (at least in England). The <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/" target="_blank">General Teaching Council for England</a>, although being the government-sponsored professional body, has not dared to challenge the unions by imposing professional development requirements on membership. (NB. I&apos;m not anti-union. I was in the <a href="http://www.teachers.org.uk/" target="_blank">NUT</a> whilst teaching. But sometimes they have too much power to block things that shouldn&apos;t be blocked.)</p>
<p>The political will is obviously not there to address this challenge centrally. So, I would propose that, just like the <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/" target="_blank">CIPD</a> (for HR specialists) and <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/" target="_blank">ALT</a> (for Learning Technologists), there should be a Chartered Institute for Teaching (CIT).</p>
<p>Membership would be voluntary, but, over time, such membership would become the badge of choice for a teacher who was committed to their own professional development. The long term goal would be for membership to become a recognised requirement for a teaching post.</p>
<p>Unlike CIPD, I don&apos;t see this organisation providing courses or qualifications. Instead it would provide a service whereby teachers could maintain a record of their professional development &#xFFFD; choosing to publish some of it as a public portfolio.</p>
<p>By CPD, I don&apos;t just mean courses. There&apos;s a massive range of CPD opportunities available to teachers, if they would just engage with them.</p>
<p>Professions, such as law, accountancy, medicine etc, all allow their members to maintain records of the CPD hours they have undertaken. I would propose a subtly different model. Instead of measuring the time taken, a better measure would be the amount of thought and effort put in.</p>
<p>The table below is a starting point for such a framework. It will need refinement, I&apos;m sure.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s say that to maintain membership in the CIT, teachers need to have achieved 200 CPD points in any 12 month period (measured on a rolling basis). Points can be gained in the following ways:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Activity</th>
<th>Points awarded</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Post a tweet tagged with #cpd</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 50 points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Write a blog post tagged with #cpd</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Publish a podcast or video tagged with #cpd</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Present at a Teachmeet or similar conference</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio if they wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Organise a Teachmeet or similar conference</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio if they wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attend a Teachmeet or other organised CPD event</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio if they wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Publish the results of Action Research in a recognised journal (perhaps even one published by the CIT?)</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio if they wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve 30 points at Post-Graduate level</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher&apos;s CPD portfolio if they wish.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The more points you gain over 200, the greater the level of membership. So 200 points gives you member status, whilst 300 would give Advanced status etc.</p>
<p>The rationale I&apos;m working on is that sharing knowledge should be rewarded, and the more thought that has gone into that, the greater the reward.</p>
<p>As I say, the model needs to be refined, and gaps filled in. I&apos;d welcome any feedback ...</p>
<p>a) Do you think a Chartered Institute of Teaching has a future?</p>
<p>b) Do you agree with the membership model</p>
<p>c) Do you agree with the points model?</p>
<p>d) Which of these funding sources would be most viable: freemium (some free services, with benefits for paid-up members), commercial sponsorship, government (as if!) - to be honest I&apos;d like to avoid government funding with all the constraints that puts on things.</p>
<p>e) I envisage this as a non-profit making organisation - with transparency in all aspects at its heart. Would that work for you?</p>
<h2 id="channel-shift-in-your-local-school">Channel shift in your local school </h2>
<p><em>Date posted: 6 October 2011</em></p>
<p>You&apos;d think the following would be priorities for a school:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving paper and printing costs</li>
<li>Ensuring that parents and students are able to find out information about school activities quickly and easily</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet my local school at least, still relies of vast quantities of printed letters, sent home by pupil post, and often quickly lost in the piles of paper that tend to accumulate. There is a better way. Imagine a school where only private correspondence gets printed by default. Where parents have to opt-in to receiving letters by pupil post. Instead, letters are uploaded as PDF&apos;s to the website. But, wait, how will anyone know that something new has been added? That&apos;s the easy bit... If you use software like <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> to drive the website, it comes with a simple piece of technology called &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot; (RSS). You can very easily use this to make sure that anything new gets sent to immediately and automatically to Facebook, Twitter, and people who subscribe by email. It&apos;s similar to the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/02/27/network-publishing?blog=5" target="_blank">network publishing approach</a> I use:<a href="assets/network_publishing.001(1"><img src="assets/network_publishing.001(1" alt="Network publishing">.png)</a>.png)There are lots of ways to organise stuff inside Wordpress. You could have separate sub-sites for each year group, each with their own design. Or you could organise posts by categories (which makes it easy to attach posts to multiple year groups). Each category can have its own separate RSS feed, so people are only fed the content they want to see. Once the letters and notices are on the site, they then become a valuable resource for when a vital piece of information is forgotten. There&apos;s always a central source of information that parents and students know they can get to. In the corporate world, this is known as &quot;<a href="http://www.publicnet.co.uk/news/2010/11/26/digital-champion-calls-for-channel-shift-in-public-services/" target="_blank">channel shift</a>&quot; (link is to a Publicnet.co.uk report). It takes time and effort to make work, and there will be people who will resist the change - some for good reasons. What you&apos;re trying to do is make your communication methods more efficient, by reducing the spend on the input, and increasing the value of the output. When the majority of your parents and students see the value of engaging with you online, and lose the expectation of receiving paper letters every week, then you&apos;ll have achieved channel shift. Of course, the ultimate in channel shifting a school would be to make better use of the digital space for teaching and learning. I alluded to this in my post last year about <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/12/07/6-reasons-not-to-maintain-a-school-service-during-closure-days?blog=5" target="_blank">snow days</a>. Channel shifting away from the need to be in a certain place at a certain time would greatly improve the efficiency of schools, and increase their resilience during times when the school building is not able to be used.</p>

<p><em>Date posted: 7 February 2012</em></p>
<p>Often, when we think about the idea of introducing ICT into the classroom (whether in schools or in the workplace), we are simply thinking about ways to change what is happening inside the classroom. In these cases the role of the teacher or tutor tends to remain the same as pre-ICT days, as does the way teaching is managed and administered. Good teachers, who were already engaging their students with challenging activities, will continue to do so. Poor teachers, who bore their students rigid with lectures and &quot;read-these-pages-in-the-text-book&quot; activities will also carry on as before - except they&apos;ll now perhaps direct students to web-based resources. Those organisations that have <strong>really</strong> grasped the potential of ICT are using it to support systemic changes in the way they work. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A secondary school in Coventry that rewrote teachers&apos; contracts to allow them to work from home via video and text conferencing</li>
<li>A <a href="http://heathfieldcps.net/" target="_blank">primary school in Bolton</a> that was fed up with having to close the school on snow days and started using simple blogs for online lessons, now builds blogging into the heart of what they do - with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/blog-early-blog-often-the-secret-to-making-boys-write-properly-2211232.html" target="_blank">great success</a></li>
<li>Companies are changing from <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/15350928?story_id=15350928" target="_blank">knowledge-hoarding to knowledge-sharing cultures</a> simply by allowing employees to use corporate micro-blogging sites</li>
<li>Companies are making far more use of online meeting software and telephone conferences in order to save on travelling time and the cost of meeting rooms</li>
<li>Tamil Children are shown to be able to teach themselves English and molecular with no input from a teacher (Limits to self-organising systems of learning - the Kalikuppam experiment - Sugata Mitra) Athens password required - unfortunately!</li>
</ul>
<p>In the education and training world, these examples seem to be fairly rare though. Let&apos;s think what <strong>could</strong> happen if we really used ICT to its full potential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers &amp; tutors would expect students to submit their work and receive feedback electronically. (Now that&apos;s easy - I really don&apos;t understand why we don&apos;t do it already?)</li>
<li>We would only use physical classrooms/meeting rooms when we absolutely have to - when it&apos;s the only way to achieve something. Getting everyone together in the same room is using valuable resources both in terms of space and also people&apos;s time. Much of the time there is no point other than &quot;it&apos;s what we&apos;ve always done&quot;.</li>
<li>We would share expertise across schools. But that would need all state-sector teachers to be paid centrally with no competition between schools. Perhaps that&apos;s a change too far? But why?</li>
<li>We would be able to cope with children entering school when they are ready for it, and moving at the right pace for them - and not have to follow our current &quot;sausage machine&quot; processes that are simply designed to support administration and management rather than learning</li>
<li>We would assess people when they are ready to be assessed, not at some arbitrary point in the year</li>
<li>Teachers &amp; tutors would be expected to engage in, and contribute to, professional development networks</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas. What do you think would happen to your training or education organisation if we really allowed ICT to be used to its full potential?</p>
