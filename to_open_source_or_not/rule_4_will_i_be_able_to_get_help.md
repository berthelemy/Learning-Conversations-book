## Rule 4: Will I be able to get help? {#rule-4-will-i-be-able-to-get-help}

The best software companies (in my opinion) support their users in a completely open environment. This isn�t just true for open-source solutions. Examples in the closed-source world include Mindjet�s MindManager and Articulate. I have bought both of those products, partly on the strength of their customer support. They will often provide online Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), alongside manuals and examples of good practice. Even better is when they open up online forums where users can ask questions which are then answered by both in-house and third-party experts. If the software supplier themselves do not provide support, are there third-party organisations that will?

### The open source advantage {#the-open-source-advantage}

Because the source-code is open, it means that anyone can have an in-depth understanding of the software. For the popular projects this usually means that you will have a range of options for getting support - from the software developers themselves, or from consultancies, training organisations and other service providers.
