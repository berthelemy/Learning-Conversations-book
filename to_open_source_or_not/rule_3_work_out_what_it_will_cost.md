## Rule 3: Work out what it will cost {#rule-3-work-out-what-it-will-cost}

Not just the license for using it, but in terms of:

*   IT infrastructure - servers, bandwidth, faster machines to run it on
*   installation - on a server or on every personï¿½s desktop
*   configuration - making sure it fits the way your organisation works, and looks the way you want it to look
*   training requirements - for administrators, IT technical staff and for general users
*   support and maintenance - making sure that the software keeps running and is updated frequently

Basically, as more people begin to rely on the software, the more time and resource you need to use in deploying it.
