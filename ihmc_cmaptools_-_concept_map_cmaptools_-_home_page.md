This is where you can get a java-based tool to create topic/concept maps like the one below. Concept maps are very different from the tree-like structures of Mind Maps. They enable interconnections to be made and visualised between any item. ![Belper Concept Map](./exportlc.php_files/Belper.jpg) The difficulty lies in knowing where to stop and, when all the interrelationships are made, then navigating around the map. The CMAP tools can save as XTM XML (a standard for topic maps) which can then be transformed into Keygraph XML by the command line tool [xcm2kg ](http://www.maths.jyu.fi/~minurmin/projekti/ohjelmistot/xcm2kg/doc/xcm2kg_manual.html) which can then be displayed in a rather excellent java applet (which can be explored, rotated and zoomed).
