Last week I led a session at the Naace Strategic conference on Social Networking and CPD. [Leon Cych](http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=61) very kindly videoed it and then did all the editing etc to get it online.

1.  Professional development is (or should be) an essential part of every learning professionals daily life.
2.  Building up a personal, wide network of trusted sources with whom you can engage is a highly effective means of CPD
3.  Using RSS & blogs as the means of building this personal network is extremely efficient and effective.

But it all starts from the first of these. We need to build a culture where professionals are expected to take responsibility for their own CPD.
