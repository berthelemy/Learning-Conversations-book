# Social media and the transformation process {#social-media-and-the-transformation-process}

#yam "Transformation", when you talk about organisations, is much more than making individual tweaks or changes to specific systems or parts of the organisation. According to [Oakleigh Consulting](http://www.oakleigh.co.uk/page/110/Services/Education/Articles/Organisational-Transformation), the keys to organisational transformation are (NB. my emphasis):

> *   Looking at the whole system - typically these can be broken down into people, technology and processes. Any change will impact on all three of these areas and each must respond.
> *   **Involving stakeholders at all stages and at all levels.**
> *   Having a clear (and measurable) vision of a future state.
> *   Having a comprehensive programme to manage the change.

As [Matt Taylor](http://www.matttaylor.com/public/papers/transformation_process.htm) writes, in his excellent discussion paper on the Transformation Process:

> Transformation is not something you do to an organization. It is a process that you go through yourself.

I don't want to simplify transformation here, as there are no short cuts to making it happen. I'm suggesting that, since organisational transformation is about every person in the organisation changing the way they do things, we should be looking at social media tools & techniques to communicate throughout the process. Social media starts with, and is centred on, the individual. It's like word of mouth, but faster, more accurate and has much higher visibility and accountability. Networks of individuals are built up through "trust relationships". That trust might develop over time, as individuals contribute useful ideas, or it might already exist - perhaps through existing organisational structures or face-to-face relationships. There are two approaches you could use if you're introducing a new tool to support your social networks:

1.  Buy in, install and configure a social media platform.
2.  Use an existing platform that allows closed networks (like Yammer, or Ning). I currently prefer Yammer as it is simple in concept, free for basic use, email domain based, and integrates far better with existing comms tools like email and SMS.

The trick then is to persuade people to use it. This **must** be done in conjunction with traditional media - posters, newsletters, presentations etc. Every time you would have normally put your intranet page address, or your personal email, say "Find me on Yammer (or whatever)". Then, you need to start posting useful materials onto your social media platform. I've suggested a few do's and don'ts below. I'm sure they can be added to. If you follow them, then your network will grow, and will gradually get connected to other networks inside the organisation. That's how change will happen.

### Do's {#do-s}

Keep it simple. Post frequently - but don't overload it. Probably every couple of days is enough to get started. Be real. Tell stories Ask questions. Make explicit links between your traditional communications and your social media communications. Respond to questions and comments. Demonstrate how to use the platform for retrieving previous ideas, sharing knowledge, raising issues, connecting people.

### Don'ts {#don-ts}

Don't, **ever**, use consultant-speak. Most people will switch off straight away. Don't block dissent - it will just go underground. Don't make it hard for people to access the platform. They shouldn't have to go through IT Services to get it unblocked for them.
