## Blended learning - back to basics {#blended-learning-back-to-basics}

_Date posted: 14 July 2008_

[Clive Shepherd](http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2008/07/is-everything-blend.html) and I have been having a spirited discussion about the concept (or not) of "blended learning". I think my last comment got lost in the Blogger system, and I wanted to get some ideas down here anyway... Basically, Clive has put forward a definition of blended learning that describes it as a situation that uses a variety of media in a variety of social contexts (ie. group size). To my mind this covers pretty much every learning situation, so I can't see the need for a separate definition of "blended" learning (which should actually be blended _teaching_ anyway, but that's another argument). I gave an example from a typical (pre-internet) primary/secondary classroom: - self-study (eg. children working through worksheets, reading books etc); - one-to-one (eg. children reading individually with me) - small group (eg. children working together on a science experiment) - larger community (eg. children presenting ideas in school assembly) You could equally use a typical face-to-face training session which includes reading, small group discussion, presentation to the wider group, viewing of materials on a screen etc. Clive responded with the comment:

> "... I must admit that my primary perspective on this issue is work-based learning, where this scenario would be extremely rare."

If that is the case then we are in a very sad situation, where, by trying to constantly find shortcuts to learning we have thrown out everything that we know about how people learn. I think it starts at University, where the lecture seems to be the dominant teaching form (regardless of its effectiveness) and we then assume that all adults learn through single medium, single context situations. So, workplace learning professionals out there, do you think we need to go back to school to learn how to teach again?

## Be HypeAware {#be-hypeaware}

_Date posted: 26 January 2009_

As a learning professional I get a lot of material written by companies that want me to buy or recommend their products. I wish, though, there was a little bit more reality in the descriptions and a lot less hype and [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt). As an example, here's an excerpt from a recent [Learning Magazine](http://www.learnevents.com/learning-magazine.php). (NB. Other sources are just as guilty!)

> [Major elearning company] unveiled a global survey that shows roughly seven out of 10 workers have been asked to accomplish tasks without receiving proper training beforehand. Within IT ... the problem is even more pronounced.

The "problem"?! Why is it a problem? It's only a problem if you believe that you have to fill people up with knowledge before they can do anything. Isn't that a rather old-fashioned view of what learning is all about? Do we train our children to walk before they are allowed to take their first steps? No! What we do is give them support and coaching in a safe environment - where failure is OK. To be honest, I quite relish being given a task I've never done before. It gives me something new to learn. Then we get onto the buzzwords like SCORM. It sounds great in theory, but is often worse than useless in practice. (See: SCORM Warning) And what about about all those articles that reference the pseudo-scientific concept of "Learning Styles"! For example, the VW case study which talked about some consultants that "found" that apprentices were enthused in the workshop and not in the classroom. They wrapped it in some learning style mumbo-jumbo and redesigned the classroom learning to include more hands-on stuff, more pictures and more reference to popular figures (eg. David Beckham). That's nothing to do with individual learning preferences. It's all about knowing your audience and the sorts of things that they respond to. The problem with the learning style approach is that it leads you, if you're not careful, into pigeonholing people, based on a questionnaire they filled in some time ago. In reality, individuals may have different ways of learning that depend on the context, on their emotional state, on the subject covered, on the time of day it is etc. Good teachers know that they need to vary how they approach things. How they do that will take into account all those factors. (Just compare how children respond on a Monday morning to a Friday afternoon!) It's not rocket science. (See: Heterodoxy: [Learning styles don't matter](http://www.doceo.co.uk/heterodoxy/styles.htm))

## Designing a large scale learning programme - 1 {#designing-a-large-scale-learning-programme-1}

_Date posted: 14 May 2009_

When it comes to designing a large-scale learning programme, the processes you work through are probably not much different to building something just for your team. The difference is that you will need to be much more explicit in your thinking, rather than relying on gut instinct. When I start out with a new learning programme I try to split my work into three core areas:

*   Learning architecture
*   Technology infrastructure
*   People (probably the most important)

Getting the learning architecture is important, but, if you get the technology or the people aspects wrong then nothing's going to make the learning work! Much of the thinking is iterative; as soon as you get one thing sorted you need to go back and work out its impact on the rest of the design. Throughout the process, the role of the Solutions Architect is to balance the needs of the organisation and the needs of the learner with the resources available (eg. systems, budgets, people). Just like in a real-world building project, getting the architect in early is essential. On large-scale projects there's no point giving the builder their instructions on what to build, and then bringing in an architect to make sure they do it properly. The architect is the link between your organisation's real (rather than perceived) needs and the solution to those needs.

### Learning architecture {#learning-architecture}

![Learning architecture iteration](./exportlc.php_files/learning_architecture_500.png "Learning architecture iteration")

### Business need {#business-need}

Before you even start thinking about what the learning programme is going to look like you need to consider the problem that it is meant to solve. It might be that your client organisation is wanting to explore new approaches to a particular aspect of its work, where the outcome is uncertain. Or there may be a need to proove that the organisation has complied with particular legal or regulatory requirements. (I'll leave it for others to debate whether that means training is the only solution.) Perhaps the organisation needs to ensure that there is a consistent skill base across the whole workforce. Your client might have decided that people need a raised level of knowledge and understanding of what you do. Or perhaps there's a strategic need to change behaviours across the organisation. Whatever the business need, you must understand it. And you must get to the bottom of the reasons behind that business need. Alongside that you'll need to know very quickly what drives the organisation's culture. Without those two converging streams of understanding, you will find it extremely difficult to create a learning solution that matches the client's needs and expectations. There are two tools that really help in this process with clients. One is [Cathy Moore's action mapping presentation](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2008/05/be-an-elearning-action-hero/). This, very clearly, shows the client the importance of focussing on what they want people to **do**, rather than know. The other tool I use considerably, especially in client workshops, is some sort of visual mapping tool. Options here include:

*   [MindManager](http://www.mindjet.com/) - a very powerful [mind mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) tool that integrates well with MS Office.
*   [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - an open-source mind-mapping tool. Fast and simple to use.
*   [CmapTools](http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html) - a free [concept-mapping](http://cmapskm.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1064009710027_1483270340_27090&partName=htmltext) tool

These tools are useful to both collect ideas together, and then to re-present those ideas back to the client as your understanding of what they are trying to achieve.

### Measurement {#measurement}

As an adjunct to understanding the business need, you will also need to understand your client's expectations of what they will measure. As soon as you put any part of a learning programme online, you run the risk of measuring things just because they are easy to measure, rather than because they are important. Online learning provide huge amounts of data about what learners are doing and when they're doing it. Much of that data might be useful as aggregated statistics (given a large enough population sample), but it tells you very little about the individual learner. The challenge is to find the things that you can measure that will give you meaningful information about whether you are achieving your business needs. Consider what it is you want to find out:

*   Learners' skill levels before and/or after the learning intervention?
*   How your learning intervention is perceived?
*   How many people took up your offer of the learning intervention, and to what extent
*   Whether your learning intervention made any difference to learners' behaviour?

You'll also need to consider whether the measurements are "high stakes". In other words, are other actions dependent on the results of the measurements.

## Blended learning - a personal definition {#blended-learning-a-personal-definition}

_Date posted: 21 September 2009_

Blended learning means making full use of the available resources, environment and people to help learners learn. It may or may not include using computer-based systems. Any good teacher or tutor uses a blended approach to their teaching. Any learner who is engaged with their learning will use a blended approach to their learning. Examples include:

*   A management trainer using a mix of group activity, chalk & talk, and individual reflection
*   Someone learning how to use Excel, by using a mixture of trial & error, a reference book and the Excel help files.

It could be argued that all learning is blended, but some teaching is not blended. All good teaching is blended. Just because a learning programme is blended (ie. uses a mixture of approaches), it does not mean that the learning programme is going to work. The design of the interface between the different approaches is crucial, so that learners are never left wondering what they should do next. Providing a choice of approaches and materials is good for "advanced learners"; people who know how to use that choice effectively, who know how to learn. Many learners, particularly when starting out on a new area of learning, often need far more structure. In this case a linear, timeline driven mix of activities and resources can often be the best design.

## Are you a learning solutions architect? {#are-you-a-learning-solutions-architect}

_Date posted: 7 October 2009_

A Learning Solutions Architect works in a very similar way to a real-world buildings architect. They act as the central point for the design of a solution. They get to understand the client's needs and wants intimately. They know that their solution must fit into the existing infrastructure and surrounding landscape. They can explain complex ideas simply to the many interested parties - in their language. They have to be flexible and work within fixed budgets. So, how do you know if you're a learning solutions architect? Here are a few scenarios that I come across on a regular basis. Let me know if they ring bells with you. Do you ask your clients "Why?" more often than they might be comfortable with? Do you turn complex ideas into simple pictures? Do you act as an interpreter between IT and Learning & Development? Do you talk to IT about bandwidth, hosting, firewalls and browser compatibility? Do you talk to Learning & Development about the differences between behaviourist, cognitivist, constructivist and connectivist approaches to learning? Do you talk to the Programme team about where learning, and its associated systems, fit into the wider picture? Do you have a healthy appetite for learning about new tools, systems and ideas that might have a place in future designs?

## A corporate learning ecosystem {#a-corporate-learning-ecosystem}

_Date posted: 19 August 2010_

Some more thinking on the place of learning management systems within a corporate learning ecosystem. The slides below start from the point of view of the learner, and their motivations for learning. We **must** understand what will drive learners to our learning materials, courses, reference materials etc before we can begin to design systems and content.**[A corporate learning ecosystem](http://www.slideshare.net/berthelemy/a-corporate-learning-ecosystems)**

## # A model for continuing professional development {#a-model-for-continuing-professional-development}

_Date posted: 16 January 2011_

Over the past few years, I have gained enormously by listening to, and engaging with a number of communities of practice; within teaching, higher education and workplace training. Existing on the boundaries of these communities has allowed me to bring ideas from different sectors into whichever job I find myself doing. Whilst at the [Collaborate for Change](http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/32996820/Collabor8-4-Change-at-BETT-2011) event last week (also, see [Zoe Ross's review](http://www.zoeross.com/2011/01/14/c84c-more-please/)), I spent a fair bit of time talking with people about teacher professional development. But, actually, the ideas being generated apply equally to almost any other profession or community of practice.

### Motivation � the key {#motivation-the-key}

The key underlying factor for any successful professional development model is motivation. I spent a long time, whilst working as a teacher, expecting my school or local authority to provide whatever professional development it thought I needed. It was only when I moved to the corporate world, into an environment where responsibility for your actions (and your mistakes) was devolved as far down as possible, that I discovered the need (and the benefits) of taking responsibility for my own learning. That's a long process though, and depends very much on an enabling culture of both management and financial decision-making. Either that, or it depends on mavericks; people who take responsibility for themselves, simply because they know it's the best way to improve what they do. Alongside that bottom-up driven professional development, there need to be some external motivating factors that will help reluctant learners to take responsibility for their own development. These might include:

*   Recognition
*   Increased pay
*   Better chances of promotion

### A deepening framework {#a-deepening-framework}

I have had the chance to observe, and take part in, a number of professional development opportunities. Some have been incredibly useful, others less so. The list below comes from these experiences. As you move down the list, the depth of learning possible becomes greater. Basically, the more you put into an experience, the more you will get out of it.

1.  Watching a presentation, listening to a talk or lecture
2.  Taking an active part in a conversation where you have to argue a point, both online or offline. There are a number of models for this, such as [Fishbowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_%28conversation%29), [Study Circles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_circle), [Action Learning Sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning), and table top conversations (like we did at Collaborate for Change)
3.  Producing and sharing resources to support other professionals
4.  Reflecting on input that you have experienced
5.  Reflecting on that input in public, and responding to feedback

This is an extreme simplification of some much better thought out models, such as [Gilly Salmon's 5 stage model](http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml) (which was designed for online learning, but applies equally well to any context where the aim is to encourage deep professional development).

## Learning made easy? {#learning-made-easy}

_Date posted: 11 June 2011_

A while back I received a T-shirt as part of a promotion for a new IT training service. It's not a bad T-shirt at all; quite comfortable and easy to wear. But wearing it in public makes me feel rather uneasy, as the words on it run counter to what I believe is true:

It's just that learning - that process through which connections are made in the brain - isn't easy... It takes concentration, dedication, and, often, mistakes, over a period of time. If something is easy to learn, then that should raise questions about the value of that thing. I'm going on a course next week. The first for a long time. It's on the [PRINCE2� project management methodology](http://www.ogc.gov.uk/methods_prince_2.asp). Given what I've read of the pre-work, this is going to be a hard week. There's a lot to get my head around, to apply to my current practice, and to remember for an exam on Friday. But that's a good thing. It means that the Practitioner certificate I'm hoping to gain will mean something. It will have value. Similarly, the expectation is that what I learn on the course will add value to the work I do. If I was told that learning PRINCE2� methodologies was easy, then why would I go on a five day course? I'd look it up and muddle through (as I have done up to now!) But, because I want an in-depth understanding, so I can use PRINCE2� properly and appropriately, I'm going to make an effort. Learning isn't easy. Not for the learner.
