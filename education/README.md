## Bill Gates: High Schools are obsolete {#bill-gates-high-schools-are-obsolete}

_Date posted: 10 November 2007_

From Learning Trends 312: 1\. Bill Gates Says High Schools Are "Obsolete": Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft recently gave an incredibly powerful speech about the shortcomings and challenges of United States high schools. Here are a few of his key points and worries: * "By obsolete, I don't just mean that our high schools are broken, flawed and under-funded - though a case could be made for everyone of those points. By obsolete, I mean that our high schools - even when they are working as designed - cannot teach our kids what they need to know today." * "Training the workforce of tomorrow with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about today's computers on a 50 year old mainframe." * "Only 1/3 of our students graduate from high school ready for college, work and citizenship." * Gates suggests 3 new "R"'s for redesigned high schools: Rigor, Relevance and Relationships (with mentoring adults). * Gates is urging, and backing these perspectives with grants from his foundation of $1 Billion, focusing on smaller schools, different forms of measurement and greater commitment to getting ALL students across the finish line in terms of readiness for college, work and citizenship.

## 7 reasons not to maintain a school service during closure days {#6-reasons-not-to-maintain-a-school-service-during-closure-days}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

Both my children's schools were closed for over three days last week due to snow. It was definitely right to close the buildings, but no explanation came from the schools as to why all teaching and learning activity also had to stop. Both schools have [learning platforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_platform) (or [VLEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment)). In my view, a school that has embedded usage of these tools in their day to day activity should not need to stop work when the buildings are closed. But here are 7 reasons for schools who don't want to use technology to maintain a service during closure days:

1.  It's too different to how we normally operate, so the students won't be able to handle it.[My response: Why aren't you using these tools to support your normal work?]
2.  Our teachers are not confident in the use of these tools.[My response: Why not?]
3.  Some of the students do not have internet access.[My response: OK. So how are you going to plan ahead so that these students can have access - whether at friends or elsewhere?]
4.  Some of the teachers do not have internet access.[My response: How can a teacher be effective these days without it? How are you going to plan ahead so they can get access when it's needed?]
5.  We don't have a Learning Platform.[My response: You don't need one. Just start by using the masses of free tools listed on [Jane Hart's C4LPT website](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html). Or sign-up for [Google Apps for Educators](http://www.google.com/educators/p_apps.html) (also free). When you have worked out what you really need a Learning Platform to do, then you can start to think about buying one to meet your specific needs.]
6.  The students wouldn't do the work anyway.[My response: What are your expectations of the students? What incentives do you already use as part of classroom management? What support do teachers get from Senior Management in handling unwilling learners? Why can't you extend those strategies to online work as well?]
7.  It's extra work for the teachers to produce all the resources required.[My response: Yes, maybe. But there are real, practical benefits to teaching and learning online that will balance it out, such as: automated marking, deeper and broader learning, opportunity for less confident learners to contribute etc (See the [European Education Partnership for more](http://www.eep-edu.org/InnService/Start/what_addval_start.htm))]

What reasons did your school give for not maintaining a service last week? What are their strategies in the case of a long term closure (such as with a flu epidemic)? Are these really practical if they're not already putting those strategies in practice on a day-to-day basis? For more, see the Naace press release on "[Two kinds of school](http://www.naace.co.uk/twokindsofschool)" [Update] Northern Echo news report: [Stranded students log on from home](http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8721526.Stranded_students_log_on_from_home_via_web/). What a shame this is still newsworthy!

## A Chartered Institute for Teaching? {#a-chartered-institute-for-teaching}

_Date posted: 18 January 2011_

In the last week, I've spent a fair bit of time talking with colleagues from the education sector.

One of the topics of discussion was teacher professional development, and how we might encourage teachers to take more responsibility for their own learning.

I would contend that any profession worth that name will have continuing professional development at its core. It will be a requirement for remaining a member of that profession.

Not so with teaching (at least in England). The [General Teaching Council for England](http://www.gtce.org.uk/), although being the government-sponsored professional body, has not dared to challenge the unions by imposing professional development requirements on membership. (NB. I'm not anti-union. I was in the [NUT](http://www.teachers.org.uk/) whilst teaching. But sometimes they have too much power to block things that shouldn't be blocked.)

The political will is obviously not there to address this challenge centrally. So, I would propose that, just like the [CIPD](http://www.cipd.co.uk/) (for HR specialists) and [ALT](http://www.alt.ac.uk/) (for Learning Technologists), there should be a Chartered Institute for Teaching (CIT).

Membership would be voluntary, but, over time, such membership would become the badge of choice for a teacher who was committed to their own professional development. The long term goal would be for membership to become a recognised requirement for a teaching post.

Unlike CIPD, I don't see this organisation providing courses or qualifications. Instead it would provide a service whereby teachers could maintain a record of their professional development ï¿½ choosing to publish some of it as a public portfolio.

By CPD, I don't just mean courses. There's a massive range of CPD opportunities available to teachers, if they would just engage with them.

Professions, such as law, accountancy, medicine etc, all allow their members to maintain records of the CPD hours they have undertaken. I would propose a subtly different model. Instead of measuring the time taken, a better measure would be the amount of thought and effort put in.

The table below is a starting point for such a framework. It will need refinement, I'm sure.

Let's say that to maintain membership in the CIT, teachers need to have achieved 200 CPD points in any 12 month period (measured on a rolling basis). Points can be gained in the following ways:

| Activity | Points awarded | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Post a tweet tagged with #cpd | 1 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 50 points. |
| Write a blog post tagged with #cpd | 10 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points. |
| Publish a podcast or video tagged with #cpd | 20 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points. |
| Present at a Teachmeet or similar conference | 30 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Organise a Teachmeet or similar conference | 30 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Attend a Teachmeet or other organised CPD event | 5 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Publish the results of Action Research in a recognised journal (perhaps even one published by the CIT?) | 50 | Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Achieve 30 points at Post-Graduate level | 100 | Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |

The more points you gain over 200, the greater the level of membership. So 200 points gives you member status, whilst 300 would give Advanced status etc.

The rationale I'm working on is that sharing knowledge should be rewarded, and the more thought that has gone into that, the greater the reward.

As I say, the model needs to be refined, and gaps filled in. I'd welcome any feedback ...

a) Do you think a Chartered Institute of Teaching has a future?

b) Do you agree with the membership model

c) Do you agree with the points model?

d) Which of these funding sources would be most viable: freemium (some free services, with benefits for paid-up members), commercial sponsorship, government (as if!) - to be honest I'd like to avoid government funding with all the constraints that puts on things.

e) I envisage this as a non-profit making organisation - with transparency in all aspects at its heart. Would that work for you?
