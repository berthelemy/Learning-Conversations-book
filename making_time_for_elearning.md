A thought-provoking article that illustrates a number of ideas to help corporate elearning work:

*   Make learning an official, voiced company or unit goal
*   Link training explicitly to individual goals
*   Tie training to annual performance reviews
*   Turn training into performance support
*   Tuck performance support into likely points of need
*   Offer "lunch and learn" events (and provide food)
*   Consider a "blended" approach
*   Tailor training to meet employee needs

It does seem to focus on content-based elearning, and misses out the communicative & collaborative aspects.
