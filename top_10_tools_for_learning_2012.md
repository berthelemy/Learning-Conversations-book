Jane Hart ( @C4LPT ) is compiling the 6th annual list of Top 100 tools for learning. Here's my current set (based on what I'm using at the moment):

1.  [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com/) - one of the best mobile apps I've seen for consuming and filtering content.
2.  [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html) - a free tool, from the makers of Camtasia, for creating quick annotated images or 5 minute screen capture movies
3.  [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - I'm starting to use this as my sole note-taking and thinking tool. The way it synchronizes across all my devices is almost magical!
4.  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) - I haven't found a browser yet that matches it for simplicity and speed - essential for a knowledge worker
5.  [b2evolution](http://b2evolution.net/) - one of the most powerful multi-user, multi-blog platforms out there. I don't use even 50% of that power, but it's been the basis of my blog for many years. Its spam control measures are great.
6.  [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) - the website/blogging platform of choice for new projects. It's just so simple to use and to tweak. Spam control is a bit rubbish though!
7.  [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) - after considerable research, this is still the best corporate social platform available. Great multi-platform capabilities, and they really understand what drives conversation.
8.  [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader) - even though the interface has now lost quite a bit of "social' functionality, it's still the place where I maintain the list of RSS feeds from people and organisations that keep me up-to-date. It's where I go for deep-thinking. The link with Flipboard is excellent.
9.  [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) - Perfect for quick breaks to have a conversation with people who are around at the same time. Anything more extended than a couple of lines doesn't work on Twitter (IMO), but nice to feel you're part of a wider community. The link with Flipboard brings Twitter posts to life.
10.  [Yed Graph Editor](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html) - I'm still playing with this, but it's becoming an extremely useful tool to me; for organising thoughts and ideas.
