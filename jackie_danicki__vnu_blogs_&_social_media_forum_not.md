Jackie captures the gist of what happened at last week's blogs and social media conference. Well, more than the gist. It's what I would have hoped to have written... It really was a very good day (apart from the "sponsor dominated panel" which let the side down). What made it different was the fact that it had real people making "it" work on the factory floor, so to speak.
