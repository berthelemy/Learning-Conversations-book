# Mini-Moodlemoot at Learning Technologies 2010 {#mini-moodlemoot-at-learning-technologies-2010}

[![Learning Technologies conference logo](./assets/lt_conf_logo.giff.gif "Learning Technologies conference logo")](http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/conference/)Next week, at the Learning Technologies conference, I will be hosting a mini-Moodlemoot; a chance for those of us using Moodle in corporate learning to meet up. It will be in **Olympia 2, Room 304 (on level 3) on Thursday from 13:00 to 13:45**. You do **not** need a Conference ticket to attend. It is open to all, including Exhibition-only visitors. I see this as working as a whole bunch of independent conversations about Moodle, with people able to move in and out of the conversations as they wish. There won't be time for presentations, but feel free to bring laptops etc if you've got something you might want to show people. I'll kick off with five questions, as discussion starters for five different groups:

1.  Where does Moodle's social-constructivist background fit into corporate learning?
2.  How do you get round Moodle's really clunky SCORM user-interface?
3.  What additional modules would you recommend to other people?
4.  What server architecture do you use to run your Moodle site?
5.  How do you get user information into your Moodle site? Self-registration? Integration with other systems? Manually?

I'm looking forward to this. A good number of people have expressed an interest in attending. If you are interested, please drop me a line via the [forum post on the Learning & Skills Group](http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/forum/topics/lt-conference-2010).
