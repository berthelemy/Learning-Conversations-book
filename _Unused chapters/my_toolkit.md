# My toolkit {#my-toolkit}

_Date posted: 12 August 2008_

I've started to organise my Diigo bookmarks a bit better, so that I can use them to publish a list of the tools I use. Initialy I was going to publish them as a Mind Map, or Concept Map - but that would just be a static diagram, that would be hard to navigate and to maintain. So I've gone with Diigo, as it's a tool I use already to maintain my bookmarks. Now I can put it to further use. I've organised them into:

*   Web-based tools
*   Windows tools
*   Mac OSX tools

I'm only listing applications that I use frequently, not the ones that I just try out for a bit. The recent additions to the list will always be available on the [Toolkit](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/12/toolkit) page on this site. The [complete list](http://www.diigo.com/user/berthelemy/toolkit) is available on Diigo.
