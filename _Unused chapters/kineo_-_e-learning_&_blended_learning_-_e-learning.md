Mark Harrison from Kineo presents some thoughts around the future of learning, by looking back at innovations that were thought to make all the difference, and by looking forward at how we will treat learning in 2012. His focus is on workplace learning, and he emphasises (correctly, I believe) the need to embed and support informal learning. This is a good 16 minute presentation for those wanting to get a quick understanding of where things are going. Slide 29 in particular offers a useful management model.
