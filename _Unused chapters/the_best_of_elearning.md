# The best(?) of elearning {#the-best-of-elearning}

_Date posted: 12 February 2007_

Elearning magazine has recently published [their list of the best elearning products and suppliers](http://www.elearning.b2bmediaco.com/issues/winter07/winter07_featuredstory_1.html). The trouble I have with it, like [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38743), is that this list just doesn't reflect the elearning world as I see it (from both corporate and formal learning perspectives). Let's take their list of categories, and perhaps add some of our own:

*   BEST LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS/ LCMS
*   BEST HOSTED LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
*   BEST IT CONTENT
*   BEST LEADERSHIP TRAINING
*   BEST SOFT SKILLS CONTENT
*   BEST COMPLIANCE CONTENT
*   BEST VIRTUAL CLASSROOM
*   BEST WEB SEMINAR SOLUTION
*   BEST OVERALL COLLABORATION
*   BEST PRESENTATION TOOL
*   BEST AUTHORING TOOL
*   BEST SIMULATION SOLUTION

Apart from the major product gaps the corporate world seems to have (eg. the Moodle's of this world), they have also totally missed out categories for things like:

*   Best social-networking environmenteg. Elgg, b2evolution
*   Best collaboration environmenteg. Google docs, wikispaces
*   Best RSS aggregator
*   Best search engine

Shouldn't these be identified as important parts of today's individualised learning landscape?
