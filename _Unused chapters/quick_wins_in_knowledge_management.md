Dave Pollard has put together a very useful description of some of the things that organisations can do to quickly to improve knowledge management. They include:

1.  Setting up a quick list of people who have been recommended as experts - along with the list of their recommenders
2.  Showing people how to manage their personal information - using desktop search tools and simple file naming conventions
3.  Providing cheat sheets which allow people to make good choices about which communication tool to use
4.  Providing ways of people easily publishing their knowledge and subscribing to others'. (I can recommend [b2evolution](http://www..b2evolution.net/) for this...
5.  Teaching people how to do research, not just search

And it's not just the list of things he suggests that is useful. It's the links to resources like "[When not to use email](http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2007/02/06.html#a1773)" that I can see being used over and over again.
