# A conversation with Ewan MacIntosh {#a-conversation-with-ewan-macintosh}

_Date posted: 16 March 2007_

I recorded this conversation with Ewan MacIntosh last October. It seems appropriate to put it online now, with the release of the new [ScotEdupedia](http://www.scotedupedia.co.uk/) which looks like it's going to become a fabulous resource for Scottish education. Ewan is an MFL teacher and a learning technology specialist from [Learning & Teaching Scotland](http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/). During the conversation, which took place via [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), we looked at a range of topics:

*   The LTS [Glow](http://www.glowscotland.org.uk/) online environment, and how it is being used to support teacher CPD and teaching & learning within schools;
*   Bottom-up training
*   Creating an online community of Modern Foreign Languages teachers from across Scotland that has made an impact on classrooms
*   A challenge to teachers in England ...
