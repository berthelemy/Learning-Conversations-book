# Questions on online learning in the financial sector {#questions-on-online-learning-in-the-financial-sector}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

This is for people who work in or around the financial sector... I'm doing some research on current perceptions of online learning in that sector. I'll publish the conclusions as a blog post in the new year. Any information you provide will be treated as personal opinion and in confidence - although it's probably best to only write down specific knowledge that is already in the public domain somewhere. You can put the answers to the questions as feedback to this post, or send it to me via the [contact form](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php?blog=5&disp=msgform&recipient_id=3&redirect_to=http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php%3Fblog%3D5).

1.  Where does social learning (micro-blogging and instant messaging primarily) fit into the landscape of financial sector learning and development?
2.  Where do online meeting tools like Webex or Adobe Connect fit into your L&D strategy?
3.  What benefits do you gain from your learning management system?
4.  Where does video currently fit into your L&D strategy? Where do you think it ought to fit?
5.  What is the attitude towards open-source software in the financial sector?

Thanks in advance!
