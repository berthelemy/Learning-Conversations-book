This article provides a useful set of guidelines. Here are some quotes: On collaboration...

> How do we establish a culture of knowledge sharing and a collaborative learning-working environment in an organization? The technology is here - both for synchronous (virtual classroom/meeting-room, virtual workplace) and asynchronous (blog, wiki, forum, folksonomy tools etc.). Collaborative knowledge sharing environments are a reality now, at least technically. But the hurdle is not technological; it%u2019s mainly political and cultural. Our years of ranking and certification-based education has lent our outlook towards learning a %u2018Darwinian%u2019 perspective.

On rolling out systems...

> Forget big rollouts; embrace small trial and error method. Try lots of things, with low risk factors, and keep what�s working. It is usually best to get them quickly into the new flow, and plan to course-correct going forward.

> According to Senge: At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind �from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something �out there� to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience. A learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. And how they can change it.

On being effective...

> Please don�t throw the drowning man another wave of information.

On learning organsations...

> According to Senge: At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind �from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something �out there� to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience. A learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. And how they can change it.

On adult learning...

> In adult learning, cognitive goals are always application oriented� we don�t have any 3- hour exam to sit for - real life is our examination hall! We need both explicit and tacit knowledge when we need it - on demand.
