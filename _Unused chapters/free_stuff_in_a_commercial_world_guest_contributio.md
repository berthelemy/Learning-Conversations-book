Seb Schmoller asked me to write this article on the place of free services and open-source software in the commercial world. The key thing brought out in it is the need for people to understand the business model that sits behind the free stuff. If the business model is not sustainable (everyone needs to eat somehow), then neither is the product. However, there are many products, some of which are referenced in the article, which _do_ have a demonstrably sustainable business model, so why shouldn't other businesses make use of them?
