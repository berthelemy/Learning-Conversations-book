I've been using [Feedblitz](http://www.feedblitz.com/) with a number of blogs. It provides an easy way of getting particular RSS feeds into my email reader. Just to make it easier for people who prefer email to RSS readers (try using [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) - it's not perfect, but still very good), I've added a Feedblitz button on the blog. When you click on it you will be sent to a page where you can request to receive the postings by email. You can use Feedblitz yourself, regardless of whether the blog has a Feedblitz button, just go to http://www.feedblitz.com/ and give them the URL of the blog you want to subscribe to.
