This free book (available from here: [Coming of Age](http://elgg.cpdconnections.net/berthelemy/files/-1/22/Coming_of_age.pdf)) is edited by Terry Freedman. The [website for the book](http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk/db/web2/) contains various comments and other stuff that didn't get into the book. The book itself is an excellent resource for educators (in all sectors) who are exploring how the internet might support teaching and learning. Amazingly, (thanks Terry & all) this blog is mentioned as a must read. I'd better try to live up to expectations!
