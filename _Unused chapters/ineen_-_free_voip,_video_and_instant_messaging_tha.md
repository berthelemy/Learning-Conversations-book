Worth keeping an eye on this Voice over IP & video conferencing software. People seem to like the fact that it's based on open standards. Although, having tried Skype ([www.skype.com](http://www.skype.com/)) for the first time yesterday (with a colleague in Jordan), I think I'll leave trying Ineen for the moment. Skype was just so easy to use, and the sound quality was clearer than my home phone.
