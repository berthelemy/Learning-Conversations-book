I posted this on Twitter recently to see what response I got:

Perhaps I should have included **all** formal training interventions, but, since face-to-face is still the primary methodology, I thought I'd start there.

As regards a measurable difference, ideally I'm looking for a wholesale difference, applicable to the whole cohort of trainees. Or do we accept the point of view that says "different people will take away different things from this training course"? That seems a bit wasteful to me...
