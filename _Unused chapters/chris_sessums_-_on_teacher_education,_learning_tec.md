Chris has clearly described how learning technologies are being used to support/enhance teacher development at the University of Florida. It outlines how they are using the technology to support both face-to-face and fully online learning programmes. There's obviously a lot of detail underneath this - but it shows what is possible and illustrates some of the reasoning behind the choices they made.
