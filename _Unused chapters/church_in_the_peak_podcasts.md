These aren't my podcasts - they're just recordings of talks given at the Church in the Peak - but this is the first podcast _site_ I've set up. It uses the [loudblog](http://loudblog.de/) software to manage the podcasts. This was an absolute doddle to install and set up. The only hiccup came because my host (Godsweb) has a 2Mb limit on file uploads, which means that I have to use ftp to get the audio files (about 5Mb) onto the server. Not a major problem, until we want to open access to the platform to other people... Editing was done using [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) which works fine as long as you've got plenty of spare disk space. A 10Mb source mp3 (recorded on a Creative Nano mp3 player plugged into the mixing desk) becomes over 1Gb when imported into Audacity. The export from Audacity works fine though, and produces acceptable mp3 file sizes as long as you keep the bit rate at its lowest setting.
