# Coaching & me {#coaching-me}

_Date posted: 9 October 2007_

I was at this year's [Skillsoft](http://www.skillsoft.com/) Cafe yesterday. A fascinating day, with excellent case studies from some of their clients, and a good networking opportunity.

One of the presentations was from [Judith Leary Joyce](http://www.greatcompaniesconsulting.com/consultant.php?pages_id=1) who was looking at how to be an [Employer of Choice](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Becoming-Employer-Choice-Organization-People/dp/1843980576). Amongst a list of characteristics of inspirational managers, she suggested they work with a coaching style whenever possible.

Judith went on to explain that this meant not answering questions directly but instead taking the time to either help the questioner work out the answer for themselves, or point them in a direction where they could find out the answer for themselves.

She said that too many managers answer all their teams' questions thus a) becoming overloaded, and b) not developing capability & capacity to learn within the team.

I agree wholeheartedly. Sometimes it's just taking the easy option (for both parties) to give the answer... but in the long term that develops reliance on the manager and doesn't build the team.

So - don't expect any quick fixes from me for the time being. Instead I'll respond with: "Now let's see how we can work this one out..."

It's like being a teacher again! Wahey!
