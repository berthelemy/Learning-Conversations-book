I couldn't have said it better. Christopher's current set of writing on his blog is really striking a chord with me. He is focussing a lot on teacher professional development, and the place of reflective writing within it. [Jo McLeay](http://theopenclassroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/blogging-means-of-reflection.html) has commented on it in relation to teachers in Victoria (Australia), who now have to prove that they've done some professional development before they can re-register after five years of teaching. One of the comments at the bottom of Jo's post was also very telling for me:

I can relate to that totally. With blogging you are able to explore and reflect on the matters of the moment, on the things that you are learning through the learning ecology you've built around you. With formal learning programmes, you're forced down certain avenues, not of your own making, and outside of your control; often irrelevant to what you really need to learn. Unless, that is, the tutors working with you can adapt to meet your learning needs (not _styles_...) I suppose that's what the whole personalised learning agenda is all about.
