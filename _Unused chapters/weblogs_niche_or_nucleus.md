This overview of weblogs in education from Derek Morrison will prove invaluable to all those considering using them, or examining their uses & pitfalls.

Even though it basically comes as a set of slides with a small commentary, there's still a huge amount of detail, and pointers to places to go for more information.

There's plenty here to encourage the take up of blogs as an educational tool. I just wish they'd been around while I was still teaching!
