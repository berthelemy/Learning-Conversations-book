The BBC have started putting online a number of their internal broadcast/media training courses. Anyone who is contemplating using podcasts as part of the learning toolkit would find this one very useful. It is "a guide to preparing for interviews for radio, including live studio interviews and vox pops." Podcasts and radio are very close relatives - so there's a lot to gain from working through this resource.
