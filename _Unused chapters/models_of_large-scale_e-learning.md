From: Sloan-C - Publications - Journal: JALN - Vol8:4 A good analysis of the state of play of large implementations of e-learning.

> Large-scale e-learning can be achieved, although it is not as simple or as cost-effective as once imagined. The models above demonstrate what a broad umbrella term %u2018e-learning%u2019 is, since it can refer to a range of learning experiences%u2014from watching a 2 minute animation to studying a nine months master%u2019s course based on constructivist principles. If one considers not just large-scale implementations, then the term also encompasses small courses, blended courses, informal learning through dialogue, and so forth. For this reason, it may not be a useful term as it focuses on the medium. Given such a variety of learning experience, this is perhaps the least significant factor. A normal campus-based undergraduate lecture class has more in common with the expert-plus-part-time-support model than this does with peer-supported- community model, say. So, to group them all simply as e-learning may not be helpful. An alternative approach may be to group learning experiences according to pedagogy.
