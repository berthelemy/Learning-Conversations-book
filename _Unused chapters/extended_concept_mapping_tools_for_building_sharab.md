> As a knowledge capture method, concept mapping is appealing for its elegant cognitive pattern enabling better comprehension. Experts can construct knowledge models of their domains directly and interatively in a collaborative manner or actively participate in assisted knowledge elicitation processes for facilitating knowledge capture and sharing, by producing representations that are easily understood by others. Construction of concept maps are often useful in the context of specific questions for which answers are sought or some situation or event that is attempted to be understood through the organization of knowledge in the form of a concept map.
