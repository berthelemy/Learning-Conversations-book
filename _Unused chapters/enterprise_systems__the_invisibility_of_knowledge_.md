> "In moving to e-mail, word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation tools, maintaining (preserving?) visibility of your knowledge work (at both the individual and workgroup level) requires conscious effort. An office full of papers and books provided clues about the knowledge work process; a laptop offers few such clues."

The main thing this article suggests to help make knowledge work more visible is to make filenames & email subject lines more explicit in their descriptions of where in the creation process the file comes. I would suggest it would be better to post files along with metadata about the file - perhaps using a forum, blog, or project management system (eg. dotproject). That way a dated record of the work done can be kept.
