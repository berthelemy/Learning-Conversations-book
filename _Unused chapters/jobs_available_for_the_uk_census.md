# Jobs available for the UK Census {#jobs-available-for-the-uk-census}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

![Census logo](./assets/2011_Census_logo_rdax_300x225.jpg "Census logo") I promised my colleagues at [www.censusjobs.co.uk](http://www.censusjobs.co.uk/) that I would mention their recruitment campaign since they are very kindly [sponsoring me for the Big Ticket Bike Ride](http://my.artezglobal.com/personalPage.aspx?SID=310589&Lang=en-CA). On 27 March 2011 the next census in England and Wales takes place. There are over 29,000 Census Collector jobs to be created. These jobs are crucial to ensuring the 2011 Census is consistently accurate. Millions of pounds of government and local authority funding is dependent on the census information - so it's important to get it right. Census Collectors contact householders to collect completed census questionnaires and assist where required. There is the choice of hours - 15, 25 or 37 hours a week, depending on availability, and work will last from 6 to 8 weeks. Help spread the word - please tell your friends, families and colleagues and direct people to apply at www.censusjobs.co.uk [More information about the 2011 Census](http://2011.census.gov.uk/) [More information about jobs with the census](http://www.censusjobs.co.uk/) [Census Jobs on Facebook](http://bit.ly/da6da8)
