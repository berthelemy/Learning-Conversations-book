# A safe social network for schools {#a-safe-social-network-for-schools}

I've just come across Learning Landscape for Schools - which states it's a safe social network. They do seem to have covered all the bases around security & internet safety; their registration procedures are quite rigorous. The site is based on the open-source [Elgg](http://elgg.net/) software - as used by [University of Brighton](http://community.brighton.ac.uk/) and [Rucku](http://rucku.com/) (a virtual clubhouse for Rugby players)... Elgg has a robust [development & support company](http://curverider.co.uk/) behind it, so it's a good choice.
