> From my vantage point, training professionals are opening up to fresh thinking. Not that this is new, but the future holds: * Targeting business objectives, not training activity measures. * A renaissance of performance support, this time facilitated by agent-based software. * Content delivered in nuggets. * More coaching and mentoring, less class and instruction. * Competencies replaced by values. * More focus on groups, less on individuals. * Integration of customers, partners, subcontractors, suppliers into learning. * Sharing replaces hoarding. * Much less dependence on formal workshops and instructors.

Interesting conclusions. We now need to persuade the people that buy the "training"...
