If you're around in the Derby area during the evening of Monday 12th November, come and join us at The Brunswick Inn, Railway Terrace, Derby, DE1 2RU This will be a great opportunity to chat with people from across the institutional and corporate learning spectrum. We�ll be gathering from 6:30pm until whenever. The pub is very close to Derby Railway station, and there�s lots of on-street car parking in the area. It�ll all be very informal!
