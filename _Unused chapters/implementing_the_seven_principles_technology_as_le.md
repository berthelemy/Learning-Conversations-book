This could prove useful as a measure against which to develop online courses. The 7 principles are:

*   Encourage contacts between students and faculty.
*   Develop reciprocity and cooperation among students.
*   Use active learning techniques.
*   Give prompt feedback.
*   Emphasize time on task.
*   Communicate high expectations.
*   Respect diverse talents and ways of learning.

Again, they're focussed on HE, but they ought to translate to work-based learning??
