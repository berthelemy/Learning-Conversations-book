> The current National Curriculum seems to be little different to that of the 1960s, which prepared children for a world in which a job was for life. The time has surely come to recognise that if we are to educate effectively for the world of tomorrow then we will need to reject current curriculum constraint and think again. In this century successful individuals will need a comprehensive and global education in order to become effective citizens. They will need flexible approaches to learning, to be able to apply skills and knowledge flexibly and be able to manage information and situations. When did we actually teach children how to learn and how to think? Are we not guilty of spoon-feeding learners in order to get them through the various hoops at the end of each Key Stage and are thereby failing to encourage them to take full responsibility for their own learning? Learning to learn, learning to think and "turning out people who love learning so much, and who learn so well, that they will learn whatever needs to be learnt" (Holt, 1965) must become the core of the curriculum.

Their "alternative curriculum" seems to mirror that adopted by [Tasmania](http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=5&title=tasmania_s_essential_learning&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) and is part of a project run by the RSA exploring a curriculum that helps children "learn to learn".
