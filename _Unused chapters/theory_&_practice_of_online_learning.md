Tends to be HE focussed, but still has some very useful thinking about designing online courses. [Chapter 7: The development of online courses.](http://cde.athabascau.ca/online_book/ch7.html) is particularly useful. My favourite quote from the book is in Chapter 2 (It's actually a quote from an earlier work):

> Sufficient levels of deep and meaningful learning can be developed, as long as one of the three forms of interaction (student-teacher; student-student; student-content) is at very high levels. The other two may be offered at minimal levels or even eliminated without degrading the educational experience. (Anderson, 2002)
