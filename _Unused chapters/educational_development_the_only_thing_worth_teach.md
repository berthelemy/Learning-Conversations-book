Leigh Blackall describes a presentation he is giving (has given?) in Otago Polytechnic. He takes a lot from Jay Cross's illustrations of informal learning, particularly the [big graphic](http://www.jaycross.com/informal_book/poster.htm) (which I think should be put up on the wall of every learning organisation!) Basically, Leigh's premise (as with [mine](http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=5&title=come_on_in_the_water_s_lovely&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1)) is that the main emphasis of any learning organisation is to help their learners learn how to learn.
