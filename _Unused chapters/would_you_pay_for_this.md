# Would you pay for this? {#would-you-pay-for-this}

A couple of weeks ago, I made some suggestions about how we could run conferences that have a wider reach, and are much more useful to attending delegates.

As a follow-up, I'd like to ask a couple of questions about whether you'd be willing to pay for such a conference. No personal data will be collected. Just your answers to the questions. If youï¿½ve got any comments, please leave feedback on this post.
