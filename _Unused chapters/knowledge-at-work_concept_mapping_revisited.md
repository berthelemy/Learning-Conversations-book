A short introduction to Concept Mapping from Denham Grey. I agree with one of the comments which states: " we have still to improve the way we use [concept maps] because they are ONLY the mirror of our thoughts at a given instant." We need some way of creating dynamic concept maps... this is where it perhaps links with ELGG & Stephen Downes' ideas about user-based metadata.
