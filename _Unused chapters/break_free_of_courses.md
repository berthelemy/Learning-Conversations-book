# Break free of courses {#break-free-of-courses}

I've been a fan of [Cathy Moore's](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/) [Action Mapping approach to learning design](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2008/05/be-an-elearning-action-hero/) for a long time. I've also been a long-time advocate of the idea of [separating our courses from our content](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/06/courses-and-content?blog=5) by making more use of [Content Management Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (CMS). Cathy Moore has combined the two ideas in her [Elearning Blueprint](http://www.elearningblueprint.com/) a mega job-aid for instructional designers. It's a structured resource, that includes interactive elements, but built inside Wordpress, a popular (and very easy to use) CMS. The short video below demonstrates the key features of the Elearning Blueprint. If only all our instructional materials could be built this way. But, when you've spent thousands on implementing a storage space for hammers (aka [the LMS](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die?blog=5)), you're going to treat every problem as if it was a nail.
