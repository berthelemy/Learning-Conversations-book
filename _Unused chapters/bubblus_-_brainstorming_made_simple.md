I use visual tools a lot. [Powerpoint](http://office.microsoft.com/powerpoint) & [Impress](http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html) are great for storyboarding a sequence of thoughts & ideas. [MindManager](http://www.mindjet.com/) & [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) are ideal for brainstorming and for facilitating meetings. [CmapTools](http://cmap.ihmc.us/) is great for when you want to get a really good view on how things link together - to come up with a concept map that is visually accessible forces you to think about the important things. But now, via [Jay Cross](http://informl.com/?p=724), there's another option. [Bubble.us](http://bubbl.us/) is ideal for collaborative visual thinking. It's a Flash-based, free, online mind-mapping tool and works extremely well. Not as sophisticated as MindManager or Freemind - but it does the job. Once they get the export bit working it will be even better so you can bring the map into the offline tools for finishing off.
