Good to see that people are starting to realise that you can't just push out a new learning programme or a new system and expect people to embrace it...

> What can we conclude from this data? It seems as though the general e-learning practitioner is getting smarter and more specific about what he or she does. Theyï¿½re defining e-learning in narrower terms--to cover the actual learning experiences (i.e., virtual classrooms, simulations, e-courseware) rather than the infrastructure systems that their organizations use to develop and support e-learning (i.e., LMS, LCMS, authoring tools). In addition, an increasing number of employees and managers are not only aware of e-learning, but also are interested in using it. More important, even though technology and cost issues ranked as their highest concerns, managers are conscious of the culture issues involved in implementing a successful e-learning strategy.
