I thought it best to follow up my [open letter to TrainingSpotting.com](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/11/30/open-letter-to-trainingspotting-com?blog=5) with an update on what has happened so far. I got a very prompt email from Tom Vinkler, who manages the [TrainingSpotting.com site](http://blog.trainingspotting.com/). He listened to my concerns and has implemented the following:

*   Newly imported posts now have a Read More link which takes you to the original post
*   The permalink to the post now points to the original post, not to the version on TrainingSpotting.com
*   Comments are switched off for new posts

Thanks Tom.
