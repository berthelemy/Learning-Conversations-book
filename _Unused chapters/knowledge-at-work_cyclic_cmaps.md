This reference to a paper that discusses cyclic cmaps in depth makes the point that "Top-down directionality in a concept map robs us of important insights and fails to portray an important class of relationships. In a way, this is similar to the arc only restriction of mind mapping." I would tend to agree, but the thing I've also been learning about Cmaps and MindMaps is that, to make them meaningful takes an awful lot of work. However more is learnt through the process of giving the maps meaning than is contained in the maps themselves.
