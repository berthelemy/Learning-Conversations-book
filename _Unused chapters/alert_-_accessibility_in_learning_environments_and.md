"The ALERT project (Accessibility in Learning Environments and Related Technologies) aimed to improve the accessibility of online learning in specific subject areas. In particular, to identify methods of supporting disabled students to enable them to achieve the pedagogical objectives of their modules through a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)." Some useful guidelines - aimed at full-time education - but still may be appropriate elsewhere.
