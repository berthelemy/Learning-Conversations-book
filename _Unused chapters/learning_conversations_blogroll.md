Thanks to [Euan](http://theobvious.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/my-blogroll-is-.html) I've discovered that [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) now lets you publish a list of the blogs you read in a particular folder. Brilliant - now I can show you my personal A-list of blogs & other sources. You'll have to come to the site and look down the right hand side.
