# Would anyone notice if we stopped training? {#would-anyone-notice-if-we-stopped-training}

How much of what we call training is actually just ticking boxes for someone else's report? What would be the _real_ impact if you called a halt to all training activity in your organisation? Would anyone notice? When people come to you and say we need training, do you ever ask them why? Keep saying "Why" until you get back to the real heart of the problem, then, and only then, can you suggest a possible solution. That might include training, but it also might include:

*   changing systems & processes
*   providing performance support (eg. like Google does so well)
*   making sure managers are managing
*   encouraging sharing of knowledge
*   better internal communications (the vital link between internal comms and training is something I want to explore further - later)
*   improving recruitment to find people who are ready to learn

What proportion of your training activity actually produces meaningful performance improvements? And, if we're not improving performance, why are we training? (Inspired by something [Donald Clark](http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/) said, but I can't remember where it was!?)
