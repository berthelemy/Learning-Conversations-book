# Why would anyone want to buy IT training? {#why-would-anyone-want-to-buy-it-training}

There are two types of IT training:

1.  What can I do with this software?
2.  How do I get this software to do what I want?

Now, if the software is well-designed, has context-sensitive help embedded within it, and a good, user-focussed, reference guide, there should **never** be any need for specific training about how to make it work. Yes, there's space for people to learn hints and tips, or to find help to solve problems (especially with complex tools like Excel & Access), but, to be honest, all this is available for free on the web, so why buy it in? In the real world, most software is not well-designed, does not have context-sensitive help, and lacks a good reference guide. But again, for the more popular packages, like MS Office, there's so much "How to" material available on the web, why buy it in? The main role for IT training should be to support: "What can I do with this software?" This is where training will add the most value. Start people off on a path, showing them how the software can help solve their particular problems. Forget the how-to's. That can be solved through providing resources and allowing users to raise questions of other users. It's the "Why" question that's the real blockage. So, here's my starter-for-ten for an IT implementation training plan:

1.  Identify the champions - people who already can see the benefits.
2.  Provide tools to the champions to enable them to share their knowledge quickly and easily. eg. [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing/) for creating how-tos, plus a knowledgebase (based on a simple content-management system) to share the how-tos. (Or even better, an integrated tool that does it all in one, like [Jambok](http://jambok.com/), discussed [earlier this year](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/06/working-towards-the-perfect-learning-support-system-jambok?blog=5).
3.  Provide a support forum, or helpdesk tool, where users can ask questions.
4.  Provide a support-desk, who's function is to answer the support forum. They can also add items to the blog.
5.  Provide a way for users to subscribe to new knowledgebase articles.
6.  Ensure that managers are signed-up to the benefits of the new software
7.  Provide questions for managers to use in their regular one-to-ones with staff that help to move people on in their use of the new software
8.  Provide facilitated workshops for staff to help explore what the software can do for them. Keep pointing staff to the self-help materials for answers to how-to questions.
9.  Identify further champions from the trainees, and suggest they also use tools like Jing to share their knowledge.
