# Learning Designers: required reading for your clients {#learning-designers-required-reading-for-your-clients}

... that assumes your clients are asking you to create some learning materials. I know I've said in the past that [Content is (not) King any more](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/08/07/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king), and it's the platform that's the important thing. But we still need to provide centrally generated support for learners. That support usually takes the form of chunks of content which learners have to work through, often in a fixed order. [For a long time](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/c17/c39/?blog=5), I've worked with [Moodle](http://moodle.org/) (a widely-used, open-source course management system). Moodle is built around the twin concepts of **Activities** and **Resources**. Activities are things that learners **do**. Resources are the things that learners use to help them do the Activities. Tom Kuhlmann again hits the nail on the head in his recent post about [Why Unlocking Your Course Navigation Will Create Better Learning](http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/heres-why-unlocking-your-course-navigation-will-create-better-learning/). Read down, as there's a huge amount of useful advice in the article. But the bit that struck me was:

> ... Essentially, the course content is like the reference manual. The goal isn�t to get them to read all of the content. Instead, the goal is to get them to DO something. The content only supports the DOING. Considering this, don�t design your course to navigate through content. Instead, create an environment where the learner has to demonstrate understanding of the content by doing something. By focusing on the desired action rather than the content, the learner�s better prepared to learn. The content is just a resource to help them gain understanding. When you lock access to the content, you�re actually hindering the learning process.

This fits very closely with Cathy Moore's [Action Mapping](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/?p=215) approach to designing learning materials. It creates materials that are focussed on what you want people to be able to **do**. Which, in the workplace, is probably the most important thing we might want to change.
