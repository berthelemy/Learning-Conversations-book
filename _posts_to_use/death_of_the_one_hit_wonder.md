In words: the amount of **Time you spend in dialogue** is proportional to the **number of people involved** x the **Importance of changes occuring**. Let's take four examples where change is a desired outcome:

*   A local authority (US: District) needs to get across the opportunities and potential dangers of internet-based communication tools within schools;
*   A government project is put out to tender;

How important is it to make sure the right changes happen, the right decisions made? Often the inputs to these processes would be (respectively):

*   A day conference - with a couple of high profile keynote speakers;
*   Reading long tender documents from each of the bidders;

Over the past year, I've been involved in both of these types of change processes, and have learnt from other people's experiences. It appears that those responsible for designing the inputs are beginning to realise that dialogue is critical.![Feedback model](./assets/300px-Ideal_feedback_model.svg.png "Feedback model")Image credit: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback)Dialogue involves feedback. Without feedback, it's nearly impossible to ensure that your input is causing the output you're aiming for. By spending time engaging in dialogue we can be much more certain that the change we want will be "right". The manager will be the right person for the job. The bidding company (and the awarding organisation) will understand the precise requirements of the tender. The conference speaker will know where to pitch their talk, and deal with any misunderstandings. How can we build feedback into our change processes? Let's take the conference speaker... We'll assume they've been well briefed by the organisers. But let's also make sure the speaker is willing and able to engage with the **delegates** before & after the talk. [Ewan's a great example of this](http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/trying_to_desig.html). What about the tender process? Often potential clients (especially those looking at something completely new), don't really know what they want. The ones that are a pleasure to work with are those who know what they don't know, and engage in an ongoing dialogue to make sure that both the client's and the provider's understanding are closely matched. In each scenario, we need to balance how much time we're prepared to spend in dialogue with the importance of getting the right result. There is no optimum balance point that will work every time. Each situation is different, and each will need a slightly different amount of dialogue & feedback.
