# Dreams of an alternative education: Philosophy {#dreams-of-an-alternative-education-philosophy}

_Date posted: 2 January 2008_

Continuing on from last week's post: [Education for a 21st Century Society](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/12/29/education_for_a_21st_century_society) and also responding to Clay Burrell's request for [dreams of an alternative school](http://beyond-school.org/2008/01/01/open-thread-1-your-dreams-of-alternative-schools/)... I'm going to work under the headings I proposed last week, and put forward some answers to the questions I raised, beginning with Philosophy: I believe that learning contributes to an overall understanding of the world we live in. Without it, mistakes will be repeated and solutions will remain undiscovered.

#### What do I believe about the individual? {#what-do-i-believe-about-the-individual}

I believe that every person is born for a purpose. I believe that every person is born to be part of a self-supporting local and worldwide community. I believe that every person is born with an unending capacity to learn.

#### What do I believe about the process of learning? {#what-do-i-believe-about-the-process-of-learning}

I believe that learning is the process by which connections are made between concepts & ideas. I believe that this learning may take place inside an individual, or as part of a network of individuals. I believe that learning is the process by which we eliminate that which does not work and identify that which does - for the moment. The process of learning observes no barriers of age, gender, race, creed and institution

#### What do I believe about teaching? {#what-do-i-believe-about-teaching}

The objective of a teacher is to help develop better learners. I believe that the teacher should model continuing learning - the two roles are not an either/or situation, and the role of teacher may not always be played by the same person.
