# Reflections on Learning Technologies 2009 {#reflections-on-learning-technologies-2009}

This was my first [Learning Technologies](http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/) conference, and I was pleasantly surprised. In the past, I've found conferences unsatisfactory affairs - often promising more than they achieve. Gradually, though, they are starting to change. These days, the conference or event is often the culmination of professional relationships that have developed online, whether through [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/), [FaceBook](http://www.facebook.com/), or via the other various blogging, [Twittering](http://www.twitter.com/) and RSS-based networks that we have. Having that pre-knowledge of the people who will be at the conference enables you to leapfrog the introduction process, since you already have that initial understanding of where they're coming from. Having said that, it was a pity that only about 15% of the delegates took advantage of the provided online social network area to interact with people in advance of the conference itself. It feels like people in Learning and Development want to be able to show off all the whizzy technology, but don't actually want to use it themselves. I can appreciate that when you're talking about the typical corporate elearning module (as if anyone would volunteer to trawl through one of those!) but we're talking here about a tool that would help delegates get much more value from the event itself. At nearly �1000 per person you'd think they'd want to... If we could set an expectation that included pre-conference online activity it would also mean that we could significantly redesign the event itself to make far better use of the face-to-face environment. You see, I really don't understand why 1000 people want to go to the effort of coming to one place, simply to sit in rows watching people presenting their ideas. How can you justify that as good use of time? Wouldn't it be better to:

*   Provide all the presentations beforehand? As videos, as narrated Powerpoints, or even just as old-style conference papers. That way, when you get a really in-depth, thought-provoking session, like [George Siemens'](http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/), you can rewind it, take notes, and think about the implications.
*   Encourage interaction before the event, based on the ideas in the presentations? Wouldn't that start the debating juices going?
*   Use the face-to-face time to pick up on the issues raised beforehand? Split us up into smaller discussion groups, focussing on specific ideas. Or get the presenter to respond to questions - posed in advance or as an outcome of the discussion groups. Face-to-face time should not be about listening and watching, but about interaction, debate and action.
*   Pick up on the successful [Teachmeet](http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/Organise/) concept, where practitioners sign-up to give micro (7 minute) or nano (2 minute) presentations during a 2-3 hour informal session? Perhaps this could be offered to delegates to the exhibition at a small cost (�30 including free drinks - or get sponsorship from the exhibition stallholders?), to run from 4pm to 7pm?

So, what I'm saying is... keep the people the same, but stimulate the interaction more, so we really get the full benefit of face-to-face time. Of course, this does mean that delegates will have to be set clear expectations about what the conference will involve. That's not impossible - the [Manager-Tools team do that very successfully with their conferences](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/06/22/what_s_in_it_for_me).
