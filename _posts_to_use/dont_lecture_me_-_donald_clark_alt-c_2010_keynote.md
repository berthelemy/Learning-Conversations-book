# Don't lecture me - Donald Clark ALT-C 2010 keynote {#don-t-lecture-me-donald-clark-alt-c-2010-keynote}

_Date posted: 5 October 2010_

If you get a chance and work in formal education, watch this challenging talk from [Donald Clark](http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/). It stimulated a lot of dialogue (exactly what a **lecture** should do), during the talk on Twitter, and afterwards, both on [Donald's blog post](http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/09/tweckled-at-alt_10.html) and elsewhere (eg. [Doug Belshaw's](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2010/09/11/a-response-to-donald-clarks-altc2010-keynote/). Donald's been debating the merits of lectures for years, it's probably a good idea to look at these posts to get some background: http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2007/12/10-reasons-to-dump-lectures.html http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2009/04/lecturing-stupidest-profession.html http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2009/10/universities-recorded-lectures-better.html Some key points to take away from the discussion:

*   The lecture is the default - so we need to abolish the job description: "lecturer".
*   [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) (and lots of other models in current use) only survive because they are easy to put on a Powerpoint.
*   If you're going to stand and broadcast - then do it proprly - make them good, and at scale.
*   "We don't need lectures, we need performers who turn learning into a live and enjoyable experience".
*   The lecture is not a good method for promoting critical thought.
*   A lecture should be as long as it needs to be. Why is an hour the default?
*   [Mazur's work at Harvard](http://www.turning-talk.com/mazur/article-intro-jun09) with undergraduate physics is a good model to look at for a new way of approaching "instruction".
*   Using lectures as a basis for learning makes no reference to current research in how people learn. eg. learning by doing, spaced practice, collaborative.
*   Why do we go to conferences, when we can get what we need online?
