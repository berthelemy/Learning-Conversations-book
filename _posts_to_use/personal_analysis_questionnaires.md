# Personal "analysis" questionnaires {#personal-analysis-questionnaires}

_Date posted: 25 September 2008_

Next week I shall be attending my first formal "course" as a learner for over five years! Normally I spurn such courses, but this one (on Account and Customer Relationship Management) comes at a time when I need some concentrated input & guidance. Most of the learning I've done over the past few years has been self-directed; based around the serendipitous discoveries made via reading other people's blogs, or through extensive internet research to meet particular needs. Anyway, the course I'm going on comes with a little bit of pre-work. Part of it makes you think about the characteristics of successful & unsuccessful client relationships (I like to be in control!). The other part is a questionnaire about whether you have Parent, Adult or Child characteristics, very similar to [this one (pdf)](http://www.learningnetworkgroup.co.uk/wisdomfiles/PAC%20Questionnaire%20+%20Scoring.pdf). By long-past background I'm a science teacher, and by recent-background I'm an educational researcher (although that may be stretching it a bit). So, whenever I see tools like these questionnaires I'm looking for evidence that shows the results will be meaningful, and for evidence that the questions have been carefully thought through. In this case, I'm afraid I can't find either. To be honest, if the questions aren't carefully thought through, then how can the results be meaningful. This means being totally unambiguous in the language used. A couple of examples:

> People nowadays should attend church more often.

I'm a Christian, so you'd probably expect me to say "yes". However, "attending church" isn't going to make anyone a better person; it's deeper than that. So, do I say "no"? But does that mean I'm saying people shouldn't attend church? On the same lines:

> The ceremony of baptism is much more than a symbolic ritual - it is essential for the spiritual welfare of the individual.

I really don't like these two part questions. What if you agree with one part, but disagree with the second? That's what I call bad question design. Anyway, I did the questionnaire. Whether the results have any meaning at all remains to be seen. Or is the whole Parent, Adult, Child thing another case of psychological pseudo-science?
