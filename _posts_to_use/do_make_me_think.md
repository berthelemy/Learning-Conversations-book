# Do make me think {#do-make-me-think}

I was in the process of writing a response to this question on the [BILD focus group](http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/projects/ROLE/pg/groups/56/bild-focus-group/): "... list 5 top aspects that are important to you when using any learning environment or for that matter any web application." My number one thought was, initially, "Don't make me think", after the brilliant web design book by [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/). However, for an application to work for someone without them needing to think, it means the application must immediately fit their current ways of working and frames of reference. For the past ten years, I've been working in the field of learning technologies; helping people to change their frames of reference, to change the way they work, to see the benefits that the online environment can bring to learning. If we create applications that simply mirror existing processes, how can we expect change to happen? BTW, my top five aspects for web application design were:

1.  Code that has **security** at its heart; where every user entry field is checked and cleaned, where privacy is built into the architecture of the application, where you know who will be able to see what you write/upload
2.  Code that I can **trust** to do the job well. Has it been tested? By whom? How many testers? Who else trusts it? Do I trust their recommendation? Who develops it? How robust is the development team? Will they maintain the code?
3.  Clear **navigation elements and workflows** that let me understand quickly what the application is about and what it can do.
4.  Design that **works across browsers and devices**, [degrading gracefully](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation), (or [enhancing progressively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)). It should allow me to use my browser how I like to use it (eg. text sizes, colours, window size, toolbars). Any application that opens in a new, fixed sized window with no menu bars and the right click menu disabled should be banned!
5.  **Consistency, consistency, consistency**. Don't introduce new User Interface elements for the sake of it. Use existing design patterns (eg. [Yahoo's design pattern library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/)) whereever possible. And then, within the application, use those design patterns in a consistent way.
