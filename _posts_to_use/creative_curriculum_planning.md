# Creative Curriculum planning {#creative-curriculum-planning}

_Date posted: 30 March 2007_

I was at Springfields Community Primary school this morning for part of their INSET day. The whole staff was exploring the [Creative Learning Journey website](http://www.creativelearningjourney.org.uk/) which was produced by Bexley Council. This was the first time the whole staff had had a chance to look at what other schools had done, and to begin to think about how to implement a skills-based curriculum. We used some of the video resources from the QCA Futures programme: http://www.qca.org.uk/12933.html to think about why we might need to rethink the curriculum, and also investigated how Tasmania has approached curriculum change with their Essential Learnings: http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/ It was a hard day, which raised lots of questions. We agreed that we couldn't see how the personalisation agenda could be implemented effectively without a wholesale change in how we work, how the school (and particularly its timetable) is organised. But making such a change is not an overnight thing. Communication is going to be key, with parents and the community to engage. The next stage is to talk to some of the other schools in the authority who are slightly further ahead in the process.
