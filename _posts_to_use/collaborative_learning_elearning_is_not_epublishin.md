This brief article summarises a lot of worries that people have about elearning - that it too often is simply a set of slides (maybe with some whizzy interactions that make the learner click somewhere). For learners to achieve the learning that you hope for, then they need to interact with the content of the learning - and do something with it. That could mean asking questions of people, creating materials based on what they've read, carrying out simulated activities, or practice on the job, with support.
