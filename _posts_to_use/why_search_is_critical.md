# Why search is critical {#why-search-is-critical}

Having a good search engine is a key component to any content-rich learning strategy.

It's important for your learners, as searching is the main place people start these days when they want to find out something. Providing a page that pulls together results from inside your documents, from your course descriptions, and from content/posts provided by other people is by far the best way to get people to use your materials.

It's important for your content providers, as, with judicious placement of "important" items near the top of the list, you can encourage your learners to make more use of the centrally-provided content.

It's also important for the "business", as, by analysing what people are searching for, you've then got the equivalent of a training needs analysis ([as discovered by Google](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ-bMbynst0) [watch from about 13:32 in the video] ) . This assumes you've got a reasonably-sized sample. If you have, then this is by far a simpler process than doing a full [TNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_needs_analysis).
