# Ideas for an unConference process {#ideas-for-an-unconference-process}

_Date posted: 30 April 2010_

#IY10 #yam Yesterday, at the [unconference part of the Informatology conference](http://www.informatology.com/conference/seminars/unconference/), I had the opportunity to present some ideas around social software. The style of presentation was a new one on me: [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/). Basically, you have 20 slides. They each move on after 20 seconds. And the presenter has to stop after 6 minutes 40 seconds. It was the most scripted presentation I've ever done. Each slide had three sentences, and woe betide me if I strayed from the script! The presentations were given in 2 groups of 4, with no space for questions or discussion until the end of the whole session. To me, the whole thing felt rather unsatisfactory. For a number of reasons:

1.  I'd tried to put far too much into the presentation. I should have stuck to no more than 3 ideas.
2.  With such a small audience (<20), we could have had some really good conversations, but there wasn't time.
3.  Ideas and questions got lost in the rush through the slides.
4.  In [Clive Shepherd's](http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/) words, it felt more like "a performance art" than a means of stimulating thought and learning.

So, as I do, I've been thinking about how to improve the process. It's guided by an underlying principle, that face-to-face time is too valuable to be spent doing stuff that is better done on your own. Face-to-face time should be about conversation. It's through questioning, debate and argument that we then change our opinions and behaviours. The diagram below shows a process that I think would work:[![Unconference process](./assets/unconference_process.001.png "Unconference process")](./assets/unconference_process.001.png)Basically, what's happening is this:

*   The presentation is recorded in advance.
*   Anyone who's attending the unconference can create a presentation.
*   To make sure it's not just existing work being resubmitted, the organisers could ask all the presentations to contain the conference logo.
*   Delegates have the opportunity to view the presentation before the day.
*   Delegates can rate the presentation as being one they want to discuss or not.
*   Delegates can raise questions and comments online.
*   On the day, the conference facilitators prepare some starter questions based on the pre-conference activity.
*   All the unconference time is spent in conversation. If the delegates wish to view a particular presentation again, then that can happen.

### Why Jing & Moodle? {#why-jing-moodle}

In thinking about this, my aim was to keep the process as simple and low cost as possible. [Jing](http://www.jingproject.com/) is a free tool for Mac or Windows that lets you create 5 minute (maximum) narrated screen-capture movies. It's very basic. There's no editing. And it produces a swf file that will play in any browser. (If you opt for the paid-for Pro version, you can create a file to upload to Youtube. But that's making it more complicated.) The conference will need a web site on which to display the movies. [Moodle](http://moodle.org/) is the stable, easy to setup, allows access control, will handle self-service uploading, displaying the swf, rating and discussions. There are other tools around that act like a self-contained Youtube site, but these tend to be quite expensive. With Moodle you pay for what you use (in hosting, consultancy, support) rather than a license fee per potential user.
