# Living & learning online {#living-learning-online}

Just a thought... Gilly Salmon ([http://www.atimod.com](http://www.atimod.com/)) et al say that learning online only works in highly structured, time-constrained groups... Is that true for people who "live" online... those for whom being online and communicating online is as natural as working in the "real" world? Or is it true only as an interim measure until people get used to being online?
