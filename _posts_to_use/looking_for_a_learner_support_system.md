# Looking for a Learner Support System {#looking-for-a-learner-support-system}

For a long time I've been looking for my ideal Learner Support System. It may well exist in the guise of an "Enterprise" system - but I want one that **I** can understand. Here's what it needs to do:

1.  It needs to be as simple to install and upgrade as [Moodle](http://moodle.org/);
2.  It needs to allow users to add content to it - whether HTML pages, Word docs, PDFs, [Exe](http://www.exelearning.org/) modules, [Articulate](http://www.articulate.com/) presentations etc;
3.  Each piece of content should be individually addressable;
4.  The metadata about each piece of content should be fully searchable;
5.  Users should be able to find content by searching and sorting, by [faceted classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification), and through automated recommendations (other people who used this also used X);
6.  Users should be able to leave comments and ratings against each item of content;
7.  Users should be able to link up with other users with similar interests/learning needs;
8.  It should be able to authenticate against other systems (again, similar to Moodle's authentication plugins;
9.  It should allow particular groups of users to be targetted with promotions about particular content items;

Can you see where I'm heading? I'm looking at a cross between a Content Management System (which can also handle externally-built content packages), an ecommerce system (which is delivering content, without the "buying" bit), [Elgg](http://elgg.org/) (for the social networking), and Moodle for the back-end administration and installation. The typical organisation using it would be one that is creating a lot of content (using, say, a rapid development tool such as Articulate or [Atlantic Link's Content Point](http://www.atlantic-link.co.uk/home_contentpoint.htm)). They will understand that the learner is in control, and needs to be persuaded, rather than told what to do. Any ideas?
