![Elephant silhouette](./assets/elephant_silhouette_sm.png)If you look at L&D and at internal communications, very often they have the same objective: to change the way employees behave or think. Why are they seen as separate functions? Why are the intranet, internal magazine and poster campaigns run by internal comms, whilst induction materials and management training are run by the L&D department? Is the difference in function really that great? Surely, if they were put together there'd be a far greater coherence in the messages going out. The creative synergies between the two departments would be huge! While we're at it, let's bring in Change Management, Compliance, Operations, Marketing and Research & Development. If we work together in cross-specialist teams, then we won't be tempted to solve every business problem with a course, or with whatever our personal favoured strategy might be. We might even learn something.
