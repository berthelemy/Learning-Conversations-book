# Key technology questions to ask {#key-technology-questions-to-ask}

_Date posted: 20 September 2011_

In a [recent post](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/09/20/it-toolkit-for-a-learning-1?blog=5), I discussed the five requirements a learning organisation may need to address when considering IT systems. Over-arching these requirements are three key questions that need to be answered when putting in any IT system:

1.  Single or multi-user?
2.  Internal or external hosting?
3.  Multi-function or best of breed?

These questions apply almost regardless of the function of the system - whether it's content development, learning delivery, project management, customer relationship management or finance.

### Single or multi-user? {#single-or-multi-user}

|   | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-user | 

*   Low cost
*   Simple to install

 | 

*   Difficult to work collaboratively
*   Difficult to share data

 |
| Multi-user | 

*   Collaborative working made more easy
*   Data can be shared and aggregated

 | 

*   Higher cost
*   More complex to deploy

 |

### Internal or external hosting? {#internal-or-external-hosting}

|   | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internally hosted | 

*   May be lower cost if equipment and people are already in place
*   You retain total control of your data

 | 

*   Often more expensive - especially with teams who do not understand the software being deployed
*   You are responsible for maintaining the hosting platform, its security and disaster recovery

 |
| Externally hosted | 

*   Total cost of ownership may be lower - especially if the supplier already has experience with the software being deployed
*   Economies of scale with Software As A Service products means that platform maintenance, security and disaster recovery are likely to be first class (but check first!!)

 | 

*   You lose control of your data and its security - make sure you can get it out if you need to, or if the company goes bust
*   You are reliant on the quality of your internet connection

 |

### Multi-function or best-of-breed? {#multi-function-or-best-of-breed}

|   | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-function | 

*   The component parts are likely to be well integrated, in terms of single-sign-on and data use
*   Only one interface for people to learn

 | 

*   May be less capable than a combination of best-of-breed tools
*   You may end up paying for elements that you do not use

 |
| Best-of-breed | 

*   You pay for the parts you use
*   You will get an overall "best-of-breed" system

 | 

*   Integrating multiple different systems may prove problematic and costly
*   Multiple interfaces may make it harder for users to get started
