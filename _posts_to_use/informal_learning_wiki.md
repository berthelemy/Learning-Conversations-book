Jay Cross's new wiki about Informal Learning builds on everything he's been working on and talking about over the past two years. It's mainly there to advertise his book (not yet available in the UK), but provides some real value in the resources he's put in the site. The document describing a range of people who provide graphic & illustration services for training is very useful, as it shows the range of possibilities. http://internettime.com/gallery.doc His superb [poster on Informal Learning](http://www.jaycross.com/informal_book/poster.htm) should, I believe, be on the wall of everyone responsible for procuring, designing & delivering learning opportunities.
