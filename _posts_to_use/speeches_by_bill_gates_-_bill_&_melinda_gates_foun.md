"America%u2019s high schools are obsolete. By obsolete, I don%u2019t just mean that our high schools are broken, flawed, and under-funded %u2013 though a case could be made for every one of those points. By obsolete, I mean that our high schools %u2013 even when they%u2019re working exactly as designed %u2013 cannot teach our kids what they need to know today. "
