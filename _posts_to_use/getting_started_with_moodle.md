# Getting started with Moodle {#getting-started-with-moodle}

_Date posted: 30 March 2006_

A lot of people have been asking me where to start to find out more about Moodle. Most, if not all, of the information you need is on the [Moodle.org](http://moodle.org/) community website, but this can appear a little confusing for new people. So here's a quick run-down of the first few things to do:

1.  Take a look at the [Moodle powerpoint](http://download.moodle.org/docs/presentations/presentation_en.ppt).
2.  Go to [http://moodle.org/sites/](http://moodle.org/sites/) to get a feel for who's running Moodle in your country.
3.  Have a play with the [Moodle Features Demo](http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=34)
4.  For a full demo of Moodle from an admin or a teacher's perspective, see [http://demo.moodle.com](http://demo.moodle.com/). This will let you play with the system in either of those roles.
5.  Install Moodle on your PC. If you haven't got Apache, PHP and MySQL already installed (not likely unless you're used to playing with these sorts of websites), then you can get an all-in-one Windows installer from: [http://goohio.com/moodle/](http://goohio.com/moodle/)
6.  Find a friendly ICT technician in your organisation, who can download Moodle and install it on their web or intranet server. From start to finish (assuming the webserver is already setup with Apache, PHP and a database, eg. MySQL) the installation should take no more than 15 minutes.
7.  Buy some cheap webspace, but make sure they provide PHP & MySQL with it. It's even better if they offer something like the Fantastico installation service. This will automatically install Moodle by clicking one button. Using cheap web-hosting will do as a starter, but will not cope well with more than 20 or so users, or even less if they're giving it a lot of usage.
8.  Pay for a [Moodle partner](http://moodle.com/hosting) to host a Moodle site. You'll then know you've got an optimised server and someone who knows how to kick it if there's a problem (which is more likely to come from the server than from Moodle).
9.  If your organisation is going to go for Moodle properly, it's a good idea to get some initial and ongoing support to help you configure the site and work out how it can best support the strategic direction of the organisation.
