# Communities of practice and learning ecosystems {#communities-of-practice-and-learning-ecosystems}

_Date posted: 20 January 2010_

To be honest, there's probably very little difference between my [description of a learning ecosystem](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/01/10/the-characteristics-of-a-learning-ecosystem?blog=5) and [Etienne Wenger's definition of a Community of Practice](http://www.ewenger.com/theory/):

> Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

I suppose I use the term learning ecosystem as it helps to illustrate the organic, uncontrollable nature of such systems and communities. It's an analogy that people can hook ideas onto, rather than a well thought-out theory. It may help some people understand how to cultivate the community. To really dig into the idea of people learning together in communities/ecosystems, you need to read Wenger's work. Or, at least, first of all read his [vignette of life in a claims processing centre](http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/excerpted_from_wenger.htm). And then watch this video introduction:
