# Is your website legal? {#is-your-website-legal}

Probably not. In the UK, there are a number of things your website must do. Some only apply to companies. For example, your website falls under the same law as headed notepaper and invoices. Basically this means that you must display:

*   The company name
*   The company number
*   Place of registration
*   Registered office address

See: [Companies House FAQ on Trading Disclosures](http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/faq/tradingDisclosures.shtml) Some apply to virtually everyone. In particular, the new rule that says you must ask visitors if they are happy to accept [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). See: [Information Commissioner's Office Guide to Cookies](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx) and [today's news article from ICO](http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2011/must-try-harder-on-cookies-compliance-says-ico-13122011.aspx). The trouble with this rule is that almost every modern website or web application uses cookies. It might be to track visitors, or even just to keep a record that they've logged in. This rule doesn't appear to have been tested in the courts yet. So take any guidance given by non-lawyers as questionable. But here are a few places offering advice: Moodle discussion: [Use of cookies in Moodle - The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations ( for the UK)](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=175081) Wordpress discussion: [How can we control cookies with the new EU legislation?](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-can-we-control-cookies-with-new-eu-legislation) Article from [Pinsent Masons](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/) (an international law firm): [Commission advice on cookies is ambiguous, data protection watchdog says](http://www.out-law.com/page-12081) Article from Silktide (a web design agency): [The definitive guide to the Cookie law](http://www.silktide.com/cookielaw) - NB. Please be careful when using the word "definitive" when talking about the law!! If you're not sure how to deal with the law, then take a look at this short video: [youtube]arWJA0jVPAc[/youtube] Thanks to [Matt Jukes](http://digitalbydefault.com/2011/12/14/a-crack-in-the-cookie-craziness/) for getting me thinking on this one.
