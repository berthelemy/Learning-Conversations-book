# Moodle and Elgg: a comparison {#moodle-and-elgg-a-comparison}

_Date posted: 21 May 2011_

I've just spent a good day in a workshop with [Jane Hart](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/jane.html) (of [elearning Pick of the Day](http://janeknight.typepad.com/) fame), as the first stage in a programme looking at the whole breadth of social learning systems and approaches. Jane is a very effective advocate of [Elgg](http://elgg.org/), the open source social networking and social publishing platform. She calls it a social-learning platform, and uses it as the base from which a whole load of activities are started, and to introduce the concepts involved in social learning. As I came home, I was pondering whether I would use Elgg for this purpose, or whether I'd use [Moodle](http://moodle.org/). It's a tricky one, because whichever platform you use, you will be using it for two different purposes:

1.  Formal, directed learning activities
2.  Providing a space to explore informal, learner-led activities

|   | **Moodle** | **Elgg** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Informal, directed learning activities** | Great for the tutor. Easy to setup standard sets of activities and to switch them on over the course of the programme. Easy to administer large groups of learners. | Administering users and adding them to groups looks like a manual process for each user. |
| **Providing a space to explore informal, learner-led activities** | Moodle can do the social-network stuff, but it takes some digging and a fair bit of work for the administrator. For example, each user's name is a link to their profile which then gives you access to other things they've posted. But it's not easy to find things on the same or similar topics. There are also other modules that you can add to provide additional facilities. | The Elgg interface is based around the individual and building their network. So it's ideal for this purpose. |

### Conclusion {#conclusion}

In today's instance, with the opportunity for an initial face-to-face workshop to iron out niggles with the Elgg interface, I think I would have chosen Elgg, as Jane did. If the programme had started online, I think I would have started with Moodle as it's much easier to move things on gently (following Gilly Salmon's five stage model), and then expanded out with Elgg or perhaps [Mahara](http://mahara.org/), which integrates with Moodle.
