# Learning & Skills group conference review {#learning-skills-group-conference-review}

_Date posted: 12 January 2011_

The [Learning & Skills Group conference](http://www.learningandskillsgroup.com/events.cfm) today was probably one of the best learning events I have ever been to. It was very much an interactive event, with few "speakers" and lots of conversation. Key thoughts that I came away with:

1.  Learning & development and internal communications are (or should be) just different views of the same thing.
2.  Many organisations find that motivating their employees to take responsibility for their own learning is a limiting factor.
3.  Changing behaviour is one of the main reasons for having a learning & development function. The experts in changing behaviour are marketing people. L&D can learn a lot from marketing...
4.  Single-sign-on between systems is critical to the success of a learning strategy that comprises of "small pieces, loosely joined".
5.  An effective global search across systems (cf. Google) can significantly increase the likelihood of people using your content and systems.
6.  Open source software is being seen as a valid option, with the recognition that it still comes with a price.
7.  Compliance training is a necessary evil. It has no effect on learning or behaviour, but exists purely to tick a box.
8.  Management understanding of the implications of learning technologies is a limiting factor to their successful adoption.
9.  Bottom-up initiatives often fail when they become too popular as the infrastructure is not there to handle them.
10.  Top-down initiatives often fail because end-users do not buy-in to them.
