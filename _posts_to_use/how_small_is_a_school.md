# How small is a school? {#how-small-is-a-school}

_Date posted: 23 April 2007_

I'd already been musing this weekend about schools, and small schools (secondary as well as primary) in particular, when I came across [Jay's post](http://internettime.com/?p=840) where he asks the question:

> Will we need schools when we can learn directly from life?

The current thinking with schools seems to be the bigger the better. But, with pretty much ubiquitous learning available using our networks (and that sentence can deliberately be read in many ways), is there a case to say let's reconsider the purpose and practicality of small schools?

Such schools appear to be suffering widespread closures (according to the [National Association of Small Schools](http://www.smallschools.org.uk/)), often removing another important factor that maintains community cohesion and viability. So, is there a model of small school that maintains quality and, at the same time, is financially realistic?

It depends really what you mean by "school"...

If a school is an isolated, entirely self-sufficient entity, which contains all the resources necessary to support the learning of all the people within its boundaries, then no.

But, if a school is part of a wider network, with resources (people and knowledge) available as required then perhaps yes.

The prevailing culture in the UK is for all schools to become [specialist schools](http://www.specialistschools.org.uk/), which means (to me) that, in order to provide the breadth and depth of education required, they have to work with other schools with other specialisms.

At the other end of the scale, we see, via the blogging network, self-motivated independent learners who have particular specialisms supporting others in a share and share alike learning economy.

Perhaps small schools could sit in the middle of these two extremes - they could each have a teacher or two with a particular specialism, that is used to support the network of schools. The teacher's main role would be as a coach, as a facilitator of learning, as an expert in how to learn and in societies expectations of learners.

There are lots of questions to answer before this model would be accepted:

*   How will the money work? Who pays for what?
*   It will rely on a network of teachers who are committed to this model of learning. Each node on the network will need to be a productive node if it is to remain valuable to the network. So do we start from within the existing system? Or from outside it?
*   What happens about the practical aspects of learning where you need to be working closely with an expert in that particular field to build up confidence and skill, eg. music, science, PE? I still can't see how that would work in a network model. Unless the peripatetic system extended to include every subject, not just music lessons, or behavioural support. So you'd have a set of travelling teachers.
*   What about the admin side of things? Could that be centralised to get the economies of scale?
*   What about the informal staffroom conversations? Is it more easy to be lonely in a small school than a large one?
*   What about the social education that children get by interacting with a larger community?

In my mind, a skills-led curriculum, in which children learn transferable skills for living and learning, is a much better fit to a networked-learning model than a content-led curriculum. But is that a change too far?
