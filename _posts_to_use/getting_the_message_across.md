# Getting the message across {#getting-the-message-across}

_Date posted: 9 June 2010_

Until fairly recently, organisations have relied on a hierarchical approach to communication. The message cascades down through the layers until it hits the bottom. We know that this message usually gets diluted, so we come up with strategies to help, like having centrally controlled online or printed content. However, this approach can't continue. As soon as people were able to connect with each other independently of the organisation, the hierarchy crumbled. The (very) short presentation below illustrates the problem, and suggests a solution. Slide 3 is the interesting one - you could spend some time just looking at the different scenarios that are shown just on that one screen.**[Getting message across](http://www.slideshare.net/berthelemy/getting-message-across)**
