# Scaffolding - my word for today {#scaffolding-my-word-for-today}

[Patrick Dunn](http://patrickdunn.squarespace.com/occasional-rants/2007/6/29/reduce-scaffolding-and-support-never-conclude.html) reminded me of the word scaffolding, in a post about [Jay Cross's](http://internettime.com/) [Informal Learning book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0787981699/ref=reg_hu-wl_item-added/026-0237550-9798074). It was a concept I first came across when studying [Gilly Salmon's ideas on emoderating](http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml). It's the tutor's / trainer's / teacher's job to provide enough scaffolding so that the learner doesn't collapse under the weight of new ideas, concepts or skills. But they need to learn when to remove the scaffolding so that learners can gain confidence in their learning abilities. Learning Designers (and I mean that in its widest sense - as anyone that designs learning experiences for anyone else) are very good at providing scaffolding, but we often forget to gradually remove it. We continue providing "courses" or "programmes" and wonder why we lose learners along the way. Perhaps we need to build into our designs an explicit expectation that learners will be given wings to fly - but also explicit safety nets for those that aren't quite ready yet.
