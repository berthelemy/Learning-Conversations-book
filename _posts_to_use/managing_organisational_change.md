Philip Butler, Senior Curriculum Adviser for the JISC Regional Support Centre for London has produced a fascinating presentation about implementing VLEs. This was for a recent online conference about VLEs in post-16 education. The [presentations](http://moodle.ulcc.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=43) are in Microsoft Producer format, which works really well, but means you'll only be able to view them if you're using Internet Explorer. The slide that grabbed me and my colleagues was half-way through Part 3.

| Vision | + | Skills | + | Incentives | + | Resources | + | Action Plan | = | Change |

This paints a perfect picture of what is required when you implement any new _system_ - whether its technology-based or not - and what to expect if you don't do it properly. Thanks Philip.
