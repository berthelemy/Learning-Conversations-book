# Shortcuts to effective learning {#shortcuts-to-effective-learning}

If you really came here looking for shortcuts to help your children or your employees learn better, more quickly and more cheaply, then I'm afraid you're going to be sorely disappointed. What I can help you do is avoid the common things that stop learning happen, or slow down the process. Learning takes time and it takes effort - on the part of the "teacher" and on the part of the "learner". By learning, I mean the process by which an individual is able to achieve something more quickly, or with higher quality, through gaining a skill, some knowledge, or starting to exhibit a particular behaviour. If you do want the best learning possible then there are four factors that must be in place:

1.  Motivation
2.  Help at the point of need
3.  Permission to fail
4.  People to ask

Yes, you might want to think that your elearning module, your lecture, or even your book is all that is needed. From my experience, I would beg to differ. If you don't have these factors in place, then no amount of "learning resources" will help your people to learn. Don't waste your money. If you want to see this in practice, just watch a child learn how to play a computer game. They're not taught how to do it. They'll rarely, if ever, read the manual or watch any of the how-to movies.

### Motivation {#motivation}

Children motivated to get through the game. At first it's just exploration, because the initial marketing did the trick of getting them in the game. Then the game sets small challenges, each one of which is slightly (not too far!) above the current level of skill or knowledge. Competition against a virtual or real adversary can help, but not always. So, when we design a learning intervention, we must consider really carefully what is going to get learners there in the first place, and what's going to keep them going when things get hard.

### Help at the point of need {#help-at-the-point-of-need}

If you watch your child carefully, you'll see that the game flashes up hints and tips, just at the point at which they'll be useful. Many games will stop flashing that hint as soon as you start to put it in practice. In our learning programmes, then, we need to think about how the learner is going to get the information they need, just when they need it. The more you can do this in practice situations, the less likely they are to need that information in a real situation.

### Permission to fail {#permission-to-fail}

Our primary method of learning, at least while we're children, is trial and error. Why do we adults think that we've grown out of that? It's all about having a safe way of failing, that's not going to have lasting consequences. This is why simulations - both IT-based and face-to-face are so powerful.

### People to ask {#people-to-ask}

When a child gets stuck with a game they generally do one of three things:

*   Give up
*   Ask a friend
*   Look up a cheat

When we design any learning intervention, we **must** provide access to people. It doesn't have to be an expert, just someone who's a little bit further along the path.
