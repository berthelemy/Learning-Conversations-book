# Recording informal learning for prospective employers {#recording-informal-learning-for-prospective-employers}

How do you record your learning in a format that prospective employers will understand? The accepted tool for communicating your achievements etc is a CV or Resumï¿½. Usually this would have a section devoted to "training", where, traditionally, you would record the courses you've been on. However, I've not been on a "course" for probably about five years now (ever since the appraisal training I [mentioned last week](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/07/02/training-it-s-what-you-do-to-a-dog?blog=5)). Yet, I've **learnt** more in the past five years than through all the previous ten year's worth of "courses". Some of that learning gets recorded on this blog. It's the place where I reflect on things, try to crystallise my thinking, and elicit feedback. But what would I put on my CV? Prospective employers will see that I've not **done** anything towards personal development. I haven't been on a presentation skills course. Yet what I learnt in 20 minutes through the [Manager-Tools podcast](http://www.manager-tools.com/2006/12/presentation-basics-principle-1/) made an immediate improvement to my presentations. I haven't been to any conferences about workforce development. Yet what I learn from the regular writings [Janet Clarey](http://brandon-hall.com/janetclarey/), [Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com/) and [Will Thalheimer](http://www.willatworklearning.com/) [among others](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/10949212512548432704/state/com.google/starred) is far more current than any annual conference. I haven't been trained in any of the software I now use, yet through the support available freely on the web I am now proficient (some would say expert) in:

*   Articulate
*   MindManager
*   Moodle
*   Joomla
*   Etomite
*   Jadu
*   MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Access
*   ...

Similarly, I've never been on any courses about infrastructure or programming. Yet I am confident to work with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Javascript, web servers and XML, knowing that, if I get stuck, I will find the answers I need from other people in similar situations. Neither have I been on any courses on how to write and cost business proposals. Yet, through working with colleagues, I've gained enough skills to be able to win consultancy, materials creation and workforce development contracts. Where's the proof? Well, it's certainly not in certificate form. There just aren't any. It's in the outputs. But most of those aren't packaged neatly enough to put into a CV. How do you do it? What do you put in your CV? Or do you rely on your personal network - of people who know your outputs - to get the next job?
