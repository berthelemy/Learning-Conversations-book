# Integrated system of best of breed? {#integrated-system-of-best-of-breed}

_Date posted: 18 October 2011_

There's a move currently to pull everything a manager or employee might need for HR, recruitment, training, talent management etc into a [single, integrated system](http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/2011/10/Elephants-of-HR-Software-Enter-the-Talent-Management-Market.aspx). Yet, at the same time, there are providers (eg. [Sonar6](http://www.sonar6.com/)) who are providing specialist, niche products within this space. So, which is the right direction? Should you go for a one-supplier solution, or opt for a combination of best-of-breed solutions? I can't give you the answer, but I can take you through some of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. Over time, you'll probably end up with a combination of both. That's fine, as long as you go into it with your eyes open.

### Integrated system {#integrated-system}

#### Advantages {#advantages}

*   One supplier to deal with
*   A unified interface, with consistent operation across the whole application (that's the ideal!)
*   Data flows between system modules are seamless. Modules use each other's data such that users don't realise they are using separate modules.
*   Simple to implement, with no systems integration work to do (again, that's the ideal
*   Often robust implementation programmes
*   Often sophisticated and well-documented security processes and practices
*   Understand the enterprise market and how to deal with large organisations

#### Disadvantages {#disadvantages}

*   Many suppliers have bought in other systems to fill gaps. You'll need to check how well integrated these are, in terms of user interface and data flows between modules. For example, if each module has its own search function, then the system is not integrated!
*   Can be cumbersome and complex to use and to understand
*   Difficult for the supplier to keep up with the best-of-breed offerings
*   You will still find gaps in the offering
*   Implementation will often require large change management and training programmes
*   Moving to a new supplier may be very complex and painful

### Best-of-breed systems {#best-of-breed-systems}

#### Advantages {#advantages-0}

*   Agile - able to respond to changes in the market very rapidly
*   Specialist - you'll be buying into their specific knowledge of this specific function
*   Each building block can be rolled out separately, without affecting the other systems

#### Disadvantages {#disadvantages-0}

*   Multiplicity of interfaces can become confusing, especially when there is duplication of functionality
*   Can become complex to integrate, particularly when there is duplication of functionality across multiple systems
*   Difficult to make best of use data across the systems
*   Suppliers are often small and do not understand large organisation's needs
