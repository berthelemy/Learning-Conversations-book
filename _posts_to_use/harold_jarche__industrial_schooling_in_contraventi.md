# Harold Jarche ï¿½ Industrial Schooling in Contravention of the UN {#harold-jarche-industrial-schooling-in-contravention-of-the-un}

Harold Jarche is alleging (time to be careful here over language I think...) that [New Brunswick is contravening the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1351). It's a powerful statement - and one with which I have a lot of sympathy. The key point for me is:

> Children are only given the option of either attending public school or receiving no support from public funds in order to seek knowledge themselves.

Until public funds follow the child into whatever type of education they take-up we are always going to get the top-down, industrial situation we're in now. Change will never happen because innovation is stifled. If the funding followed the child, then parents could choose from a range of education methods and organisations which are currently only options for the relatively well-off - eg. home schooling, innovative small schools etc. Yes, there would still be inequity. The more well-off would still be able to buy "quality". I can't see a way around that. And there would always be the problem of the government proving that the money's been well-spent. Governments will always take a short-term view of measurement and thus measure what's easy rather than what's meaningful. And the problem with innovation is that there will be some failures - it's how we learn after all! Will a government take a risk like that? Only when society starts to take learning seriously as something each individual is responsible for. Some people will say I'm arguing for the privatisation of education... well, if that's what it takes to create an education system that meets the needs of the 21st Century then yes. Although, perhaps I would regulate the system to keep the profits inside it instead of going to shareholders... There's a lot more to think about here. But thanks Harold for stimulating the process of political change.
