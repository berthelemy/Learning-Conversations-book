# Project Initiation Questions {#project-initiation-questions}

_Date posted: 19 January 2011_

In my experience, and that of others I talk to, a lot of training projects and programmes flounder simply because the right questions were not asked at the beginning. The list of questions below is not exhaustive, but covers the main areas that you would (ideally) want to discuss with a potential client before even putting in a costed proposal. It comes from conversations on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and the [Learning & Skills Group forum](http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/forum/topics/initial-questions-for-a-client), as well as personal experience. Remember, though, that it's not enough just to ask the questions. You need to ask the right people, and have the right people doing the asking. Otherwise you'll end up with a series of answers that are no use to anyone. Many of the answers to these questions will also lead to further questions, so don't skimp on the time you allow for this process. I've grouped them roughly according to the type of knowledge, to help identify suitable people to have the conversations. There is some overlap, so you will find the questions replicated in some cases.

### Performance Improvement {#performance-improvement}

*   What measurable business goal are you aiming to achieve through this learning programme?
*   Do you expect people to work through this once only? If so, are you aware that most of what we read is forgotten within 20 minutes? If not, then how will people find the information again? (NB. Locking information out of sight is [what an LMS does best](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die?blog=5))
*   What information do you need to gather to check whether you have reached your goal?
*   What do your high-performing people already do that helps the organisation to achieve your measurable business goal?
*   How will you assess whether performance has improved?

### Strategy, Management and Culture {#strategy-management-and-culture}

*   How will learners find out about this learning programme?
*   What motivational factors will encourage learners to engage with the learning programme?
*   Who are the learners? Why do they need to undertake this learning programme? What's in it for them?
*   What barriers or constraints will prevent the learners from engaging with the programme?

### Systems {#systems}

*   Do you wish to control access to the materials (inside the organisation, from outside the organisation)? Do you have an existing system to handle this?
*   Do you need to be able to edit the content at a later date?
*   Do you wish to use audio or video? If so, where will this be hosted (eg. internally, Youtube)?
*   Does the user-facing systems need to be tested and verified for accessibility and standards compliance? If so, against which standards? Do you require independent testing?
*   What will be the process by which a learner gains access to this programme? (From not knowing anything to beginning to engage)
*   Do you have a Learning Management System that will accept SCORM packaged materials? If not, where will the materials be hosted, and how will access be controlled (if required)?
*   Do all your learners have access to the internet?
*   Do all your learners have access to your intranet?
*   Where will people access the materials? Home? Work? Desktop? Mobile?
*   How will you assess whether performance has improved? Do you have an LMS or similar to help handle this?
*   Which elements, if any, of the SCORM specification do you require to be implemented: content packaging, metadata, run-time? (See: [SCORM Warning](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5))
*   How often will you need to update the content of the materials?
*   Do you expect people to refer back to this material whilst doing their job? If so, we may need to include search and additional navigation elements to aid this (similar to the contents and index pages of a book).

### Content design and build {#content-design-and-build}

*   Do you wish any online materials to be personalised by the user? eg. font size, colour, widgets
*   Do you have any published style and branding guidelines?
*   Do you have a large (500+ photo) image library? If not, can we use a stock library?
*   Do you wish to use audio or video? If so, where will this be hosted (eg. internally, Youtube)? What functions are required ï¿½ pause/rewind/select chapters/volume control /close captions?)
*   Are you happy for users to scroll to find additional information?
*   When viewed on a normal desktop or laptop computer, what is the minimum screen width we should design against?
*   Do you need to be able to edit the content at a later date?
*   Can your learners view Flash based content? Which version of Flash?
*   On which browser(s) (and versions) should the learning materials work?
*   Does the learning content need to be tested and verified for accessibility and standards compliance? If so, against which standards? Do you require independent testing?
*   A typical learning resource is structured as follows: Programme -> Modules -> Units -> Pages. How many modules, units and pages will be required?
*   Where will people access the materials? Home? Work? Desktop? Mobile?
*   How will you assess whether performance has improved?
*   How often will you need to update the content of the materials?
*   Is this module part of a wider set of modules? If so, and if you expect people to refer back to this material, then they should be built as a single package, with integrated navigation and search.
*   Do you expect people to refer back to this material whilst doing their job? If so, we may need to include search and additional navigation elements to aid this (similar to the contents and index pages of a book).
*   Remembering that most people do not like to read on-screen, why deliver this as an online programme, rather than a downloadable document which can be printed?

### Project Management {#project-management}

*   Who will be responsible for signing off each stage of the project?
*   How much time will this person have available to work with the project team?
*   Who is your subject matter expert?
*   How many layers of management require to be consulted before each sign-off?
*   When do you need this learning programme to begin?
