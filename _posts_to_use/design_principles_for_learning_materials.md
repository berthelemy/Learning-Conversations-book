# Design principles for learning materials {#design-principles-for-learning-materials}

_Date posted: 16 March 2010_

#yam This post attempts to set out some design principles to guide us when creating learning materials. Like the laws of music, these principles are designed to be broken, but only when there�s good reason to do so. When we create mixed packages, we need to decide which design characteristics from each type should be adopted. I've identified three main types of learning materials:

*   Reference/performance support - designed primarily to enable users to find up-to-date information, guidance and tutorials quickly
*   Tutorial - designed to present a way of doing a task or to introduce a concept
*   Hearts and minds - designed to change attitudes, stimulate a need or promote an idea

For each of these I have listed below some examples, how they might be used, and the principle design characteristics (some essential and some optional). Out of necessity, these are simplistic, but I hope they're useful as a [heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) approach to design. Obviously I would welcome any comments or criticism.

### Reference/performance support {#reference-performance-support}

Examples include:

*   software reference manual
*   process documentation
*   glossary
*   hints and tips

Typical usage:

*   Random access
*   After training
*   Search
*   Browse related items
*   Quick in and out

Essential design characteristics:

*   Searchable
*   Deep, coherent menu structure
*   individual items each addressable
*   Links to related items
*   Full browser window
*   Medium text amounts

Optional design characteristics:

*   User generated content
*   Ratings
*   Comments
*   Dynamically generated pages (ie. through a content management system)
*   Page use statistics

### Tutorial {#tutorial}

Examples include:

*   introduction to using a particular aspect of software
*   introduction to doing a particular process

Typical usage:

*   Work through step by step
*   **Not** for reference

Essential design characteristics:

*   Linear, step-by-step navigation
*   Short (no more than 10 screens or 5 minutes)
*   Clear start and finish
*   Low word count
*   Practice activities
*   Links to reference guide where available
*   Partial browser window (either in popup or embedded)

Optional design characteristics:

*   High reliance on graphics and images
*   Assessed items � eg. with quiz or branching decisions
*   SCORM packaged
*   SCORM tracking
*   SCORM assessment

### Hearts and minds {#hearts-and-minds}

Examples include:

*   poster
*   advert
*   presentation

Typical usage:

*   Glanced at
*   As a discussion starter

Design characteristics:

*   Strong images
*   Ultra-low word count
*   Extremely simple navigation � probably linear
*   Longer versions need a storyline to progress the user through it
