# "Developing a learning ecosystem" - Google's Sudhir Giri at ALT-C 2010 {#developing-a-learning-ecosystem-google-s-sudhir-giri-at-alt-c-2010}

I saw Sudhir at an earlier conference last year, where he covered how Google is exploring new ways of supporting learning internally. The video below is basically the same talk, but from the [ALT-C conference](http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2010/index.html). Two key things that came out for me:

1.  How it's possible, instead of going through a "painful" Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process, to use the terms people are searching for to understand what are their training needs.
2.  The exciting G-Whiz tool, which allows other people to tag you with what they think you're good at. (NB. There are controls built in!) This then means it's possible to find expertise in the company very easily.
