# New learning models {#new-learning-models}

_Date posted: 24 December 2008_

The presentation below is based on one I did for a workshop a few weeks back. It tries to pull together a whole bunch of ideas from around the world, to show how education is changing. It's designed to be a stimulus for further thought and discussion.![New learning models first slide](./exportlc.php_files/New Learning Models Articulate small.png "New learning models first slide")
