# You don't need Photoshop {#you-don-t-need-photoshop}

_Date posted: 22 February 2011_

I use a lot of templates from places like [Open Source Web Design](http://www.oswd.org/). Often these templates come with the source files for the graphics/images. Often these have the extension .psd ie. they're Photoshop files. If I needed to edit the graphics, I had two options. I could work with the bitmaps (ie. jpgs, gifs, pngs) - a very painful process. Or I could find someone with Photoshop who could break up the image into its consituent layers and edit them. The image editor I use is [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/). To my graphically unsophisticated needs it is ideal; a massive step up from MS Paint (yuk!) yet without the learning curve of Photoshop et al. Most of the time I'm just cropping, changing colours, and extracting bits of an image to overlay on another image. Nothing fancy. Don't get me wrong. Paint.net is capable of far more than that. I've not scratched the surface yet.![Paint.net screenshot](./assets/paint.net.png)Today I discovered that I could also open .psd files in Paint.net - using the [Photoshop file plugin](http://frankblumenberg.de/doku/doku.php?id=paintnet:psdplugin). It was a revelation... The [NewsPortal template](http://www.designsbydarren.com/web_templates/pic.php?id=13) contains a simple graphic showing three overlaid documents with varying levels of transparency. All I needed to do was changing the basic colour from blue to green.![blue NewsPortal header](./assets/header_bg.gif)To do so in a bitmap editor was virtually impossible, as there are many different shades of blue in the image. Open it up with the Photoshop file plugin in Paint.net and you see the four consituent layers. The bottom one is the plain blue background on which all the white document images sit.![Layers window](./assets/layers.png)Then all I needed to do was change the blue to the appropriate green and hey presto! (In fact it took longer to write this explanation than to do the whole thing - including install the plugin).![Green NewsPortal header](./assets/header_bg_green.gif)
