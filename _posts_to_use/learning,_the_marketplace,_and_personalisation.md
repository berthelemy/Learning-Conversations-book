Stephen Downes talking about [Chris Sessums's School 2.0 manifesto](http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/150678.html):

> "learning is not about commerce and it's not about markets."

Well, I'm not sure I agree totally here. You could argue that learning is very much about the marketplace. People that are designing "learning opportunities" (whatever they might be) need to be adept at understanding the market in which they are operating and the factors that will motivate people to engage with those learning opportunities. School 1.0 is very much about the centre telling people what they should learn. I would argue that School 2.0 is about the learner having choice & control. Which sort of fits in with the new [DfES report on the future of schooling](http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/default.aspx?PageFunction=productdetails&PageMode=publications&ProductId=DFES-04255-2006&). This has a major focus on personalisation - but I don't think they have understood that real personalisation of learning will mean a major rethink in what we consider "school". How can we personalise when we force _who_ our children work with? How can we personalise when the timetable fixes _when_ they are going to do certain things? [Edit: I take it back. Reading the report properly shows that the authors do have a real grasp of the possibilities and the implications. For example, on page 26, they talk about how schools might be reconfigured:

> *   changes to the traditional school day and greater access via the internet to interactive learning opportunities, enabling 24-hour access to learning
> *   some �stage not age� models of school organisation, in which children and young people are not routinely taught with others of the same age but, instead, according to their attainment
> *   integrated and extended organisations, which have school functions at their core but are not constrained by them, incorporating other services in a �learning centre�
> *   more all-age schools, thus abolishing the need for transition between the primary and secondary phases
> *   school designs that deliberately do away with long corridors and hiding places, with a positive impact on behaviour
> *   spaces that can be used for more than one purpose, and classrooms that support a range of teaching approaches

Now that's exciting! Edit end] True personalisation will take place when each learner (not necessarily a child?) has a purpose for what they are learning, and understands that purpose (not just the lesson objectives, but how it fits into their lives at that point in time). They will have control over who they work with, when they work and what resources they use to achieve that purpose. Where does the teacher fit in? As a marketeer - persuading, demonstrating, guiding, explaining - but all the time knowing that the learner (or perhaps their parent/guardian) is actually the one in control. Is that too idealistic? Perhaps. Will it ever happen? Unlikely without a major shift in the public perception of what learning is all about - that learning is a continuous process - that we'll never have learnt enough - that one of the most important lessons is learning how to learn.
