# What is the purpose of education? {#what-is-the-purpose-of-education}

[![Purpos/ed logo](./assets/purposed_voice.jpg)](http://purposed.org.uk/)Part of the [purpos/ed project](http://purposed.org.uk/). In a recent Twitter post, I said that I think that "the purpose of education is to develop a creative society that will ask difficult questions." I've made no mention of children, but, in all the posts in [this distributed conversation](http://purposed.org.uk/archive/), everyone seems to assume that education is something that society does with (or to) the youngest members of that society, until such a point at which they can learn on their own. Actually, from my point of view, we seem to do the opposite. We take children, who are literally "born learners", and we educate the ability to learn out of them, by forcing them through the sausage-machine that is our "education system". As [Lou McGill so eloquently states](http://loumcgill.co.uk/?p=466), from her experience, the state education system "offers a standardised one-dimensional approach that assumes a commonality of potential." How can we expect people to be creative, if we expect them all to achieve certain, set, targets, and disparage certain areas of learning as less important than others? The trouble is, our whole society, politically, economically, socially and educationally, is driven by competition rather than cooperation, on being seen to be better than others, rather than just being. We're all in it. There's almost no escape. It's part of our psyche. Our lives are built on becoming "better than" others.

> ... I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. **I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation**, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. ([Philippians 4:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204&version=NIV) - sorry to my non-religious friends, but it's relevant)

Let's say we do break free of discontentment. What then? What would be the purpose of education if we didn't have to keep proving ourselves? It would be about achieving our individual potential. It would be about helping each other to find out what we are good at, and developing those skills/gifts/talents. Not to be better than someone else, but to be as good as we can get. It would be about encouraging the creative minds we're born with, and developing them - not stifling them. It would be about looking out for injustice and not accepting it. It would be about being able to tell people how we feel, and about dealing with ourselves when we get hurt. It would be about learning about how the behaviour of this amazingly complex universe can be described by the most simple maths (eg. E = mc<sup>2</sup> - why???!). It would be about imagining yourself in someone else's shoes, having compassion, and knowing what to do about it. Stephen Downes says it so much better than me in his post: "[Things you really need to learn](http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/08/things-you-really-need-to-learn.html)" So, to summarise, the purpose of education in our current society is to become better than other people. If you're not satisfied with that (and I'm not), then you need to rethink what life is about, and then the purpose of education is to achieve your own, individual potential alongside other people.
