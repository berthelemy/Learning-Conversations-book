# If I was in charge ... {#if-i-was-in-charge}

On the [21st Century Learning Skills LinkedIn Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=2966423), Rhys Brookes recently asked the question:

> You have a blank canvas, no limitations, it's your company.. How would you ensure knowledge and best practice was shared amongst colleagues? And how would you bring new and existing staff up to speed in the shortest time possible?

This is something I've been thinking about for a while. My first reaction would be to get rid of any existing training department... At the moment, most training departments are in the commodity business. They are measured by how many classroom courses they deliver or how many times their elearning course is accessed. That can not be a good model for providing effective training and learning support to the business! Secondly, I'd start a new department called "Performance Improvement", who's remit is to:

1.  look at what the organisation needs
2.  look at what learners need
3.  look at what the organisation can offer
4.  look at what learners can offer

Thirdly, I would make friends with the IT department and any Risk & Compliance managers in the business. Their buy-in will be critical. Fourthly, I'd be looking at:

1.  Implementing feedback and coaching practices along the lines of those promoted by [www.manager-tools.com](http://www.manager-tools.com/) - I haven't found anything else that makes so much sense.
2.  Systems that will help learners to find resources quickly. Probably based around a central search system, supported by an organisation managed content management system, a social networking / micro-blogging tool like SocialCast, a social media tool like Jambok, and an IT support tool like Trainer1's Context Sensitive Learning. The precise balance and choice of systems would depend greatly on the type of work people do.
3.  Working with Internal Communications to create a joined-up ongoing performance improvement & communications strategy / process
4.  Working with the IT Helpdesk, to ensure that the advice they give is shared within our user-searchable systems.

Fifthly, I'd look at where there is a specific need for formal learning interventions, and work out the best approach for each one. And finally, I'd look at implementing a Learning Management System (LMS). How can I say that, given [yesterday's post](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die?blog=5)? Well, I've been persuaded, by [Ryan Tracey](http://ryan2point0.wordpress.com/), that there is a role for the LMS. It's not about delivering content. Instead, the LMS is there for the sole purpose of assessment. Forget compliance "courses" that tell you stuff and then test you on it straight away. From a learning point of view that's an expensive waste of time. Most of that knowledge will be lost after 20 minutes. Instead, focus on making sure your assessment is rigorous and meaningful. Point your employees towards relevant content if necessary, and give them as many times as they need to complete it.
