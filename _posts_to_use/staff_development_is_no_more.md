# Staff development is no more? {#staff-development-is-no-more}

David Warlick - a commentator on teaching and learning in the US - has posted a thought-provoking piece entitled: "OK, no more staff development" in which he proposes we should be aiming for a school environment in which teachers: * Have the time to reflect and retool (at least three hours a day), * Have ready access to local and global ideas and resources that are logically and socially indexed, * Have the skills to research, evaluate, collaborate, remix, and implement new tools and techniques (contemporary literacy), * Are part of an ongoing professional conversation where the expressed purpose is to provoke change (adapt), * Leave the school from time to time to have their heads turned by new experiences, * Share what they and their students are doing with what they teach and learn %u2014 their information products and relics of learning become an explicit and irresistibly interwoven part of the school%u2019s culture. He goes on to say: "If we are trying to help our students to become life-long-learners, then this is what teachers should be right now." Then Jeff, a teacher in Shanghai, posts his reflections on his 25% CPD time, in which he says: This has been the best day of PD I could ever hope for. I was in control of my learning. I was able to click on links that were interesting and ignore the information that I felt didn%u2019t apply to me. I read, commented, reflected, bookmarked, and just felt the excitement inside me grow as I found some great stuff. Does this sound too idealistic to you - or is this something we should be aiming at?
