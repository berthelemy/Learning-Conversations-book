# Dreams of an alternative education: Curriculum {#dreams-of-an-alternative-education-curriculum}

_Date posted: 3 January 2008_

This is part 3 of a series of posts looking at an alternative model for K-12 education. Curriculum, for me, means what skills, knowledge & behaviours do learners need to develop as a result of our learning intervention. Just to keep things manageable, we need some way of organising/categorising the curriculum. In the past this has predominantly been centred on subjects - discrete areas of knowledge, driven by the subjects studied at universities. However, this subject-based framework is becoming an anachronism that simply exists because it "always" has done. It has little or no meaning outside of the formal education system, and even universities are taking a more holistic, cross-discipline approach. Tasmania's research-based [Essential Learnings](http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/references.htm#ELsresources) provide a potentially coherent & holistic framework for a modern education system. Their five curriculum headings have much more relevance to living in today's society:

*   Thinking
*   Communicating
*   Personal Futures
*   Social Responsibility
*   World Futures

My understanding of the Tasmanian curriculum is that it is not content and knowledge-based. Instead the content used to support the learning outcomes is decided locally. The [Essential Learning framework 1 document](http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/ELsresources/essentiallearnings1.pdf) is a superbly reasoned argument for their approach to the curriculum. Each heading has the following description, along with more detail than I can include here:

> ### Thinking {#thinking}
> 
> The ability of individuals to think flexibly and creatively and to manage their learning throughout life is increasingly vital to personal success and effective communities. Thinking clearly and compassionately is prerequisite to fulfilling a role as an active and concerned citizen and to following personal pursuits successfully. Workplace requirements and career paths are likely to change frequently over a lifetime and the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and make informed choices and decisions will be of paramount importance. The transmission of information is rapidly increasing in volume and pace. This demands a capacity to think quickly and clearly about options and opinions in order to evaluate their veracity, applicability and consequences. Higher-order thinking is increasingly essential in dealing with the complex problems facing individuals and organisations. Ethical, altruistic and long-range thinking are crucial to the future of society.
> 
> ### Communicating {#communicating}
> 
> The ability to use a range of symbols to create, express and communicate meaning is essential to learning and to living productively in a complex world. Facility with language and symbolic systems provides the means to relate effectively with others, to select and evaluate personal and life options, and to plan, adapt and enact purposeful futures with openness to learning throughout life. In an era of global communications, having creative and flexible communicative competence is fundamental to our personal, recreational and vocational opportunities. Increasingly, the capacity to interact critically with communications created and presented by others is crucial to making reasoned and informed choices and decisions. Being able to articulate our point of view thoughtfully and persuasively is essential to full participation in social and civic life as members of a democratic community.
> 
> ### Personal Futures {#personal-futures}
> 
> Young people need to be provided with educational experiences that will enable them to deal successfully with current and future change with optimism and resilience. Our economic and social systems are changing. Support structures that formerly provided individuals with a sense of identity and direction, such as relatively stable families, traditional membership of religious organisations and security of work, are also changing. Technology is advancing at an accelerating pace. Ethical dilemmas abound in the modern world and learners increasingly need to examine value positions implicit in issues, think critically about all perspectives to determine their own position, deal with current challenges, and contribute to preferred futures for themselves and their community.
> 
> ### Social Responsibility {#social-responsibility}
> 
> In a fluid and complex global community faced with challenging choices and decisions that will affect the future of humanity and of the planet, it is imperative that we are prepared to participate actively, creatively, optimistically and responsibly as citizens in democratic communities.
> 
> ### World Futures {#world-futures}
> 
> The future of the world depends on our having the understandings, dispositions and skills to make responsible decisions to achieve a balance between acting for human benefit and sustaining ecological systems. A sense of connection with the natural world helps us to act thoughtfully and with sensitivity and care. Scientific and technological innovation is wide-ranging and occurring at a rapid pace. While this offers opportunities to participate in a new age of design and development, with the potential to enhance quality of life, these innovations must be evaluated in terms of personal, social and environmental impact and values.![Essential Learnings Schematic](./exportlc.php_files/essential_learning_schematic.png "Essential Learnings Schematic")Essential Learnings Schematic - from [Introduction to the Outcomes & Standards](http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/ELsresources/outcomesintro.pdf)
