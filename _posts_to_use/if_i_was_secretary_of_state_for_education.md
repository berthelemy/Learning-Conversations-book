# If I was Secretary of State for Education .... {#if-i-was-secretary-of-state-for-education}

Not that that's likely, since I like my independence too much to be tied to a party line! But, if I was Secretary of State for Education, or Schools Minister, or whatever the current title was, I would do the following (_Edit following feedback_: Items 2 & 3 are a bit techy, after that it gets onto the more educational, political and managerial stuff):

1.  Rebuild the professionalism that teachers have given up and had taken from them over the past twenty years - by requiring the [General Teaching Council](http://www.gtce.org.uk/) to adopt continuing professional development regimes similar to other professions, such as [doctors](http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/continuing_professional_development/cpd_guidance.asp), [solicitors](http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/cpd.page) and [accountants](http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/features/2040447/cpd-institute-chartered-accountants-england-wales).
2.  Allow teachers to spend more time on their own professional development rather than writing out planning documents - by encouraging the development and use of ICT-based planning tools (such as [Skillsfactory](http://www.skillsfactory.co.uk/)). This would be achieved through government promoting an XML machine readable standard for curriculum documentation, including the National Curriculum and QCA schemes of work, but also to include curricula and schemes of work from other publishers, who may even be individual schools or teachers.
3.  Adopt the [Moodle XML backup](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_backup) format as a required standard for the transfer of information between online Learning Platforms. This would then take the focus away from [SCORM](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5), encourage much richer online educational experiences and allow publishers and teachers to really explore what online learning can mean.
4.  Immediately remove the SATS tests at Y2 and Y6, thus taking away the [skewing affect these currently have on our children's education](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/07/24/open-letter-to-ed-balls-secretary-of-sta?blog=5). They would be replaced by an ongoing, long-term, sample-based research project designed to investigate the state of education within our primary schools.
5.  Immediately remove the concept of school league tables, which encourage an unhelpful climate of competition between schools, and instead require schools to demonstrate cooperation with other schools, through, for example, shared management, shared facilities management, shared teachers, and shared facilities.
6.  Minimise government interference in how schools are run, how teaching takes place, and what children learn. There is no one-size-fits-all in education. Instead, allow gifted, creative teachers to use their specialisms within a broad framework (such as that already proposed by the [Rose Review](http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/primarycurriculumreview/)), but without the micro-managed detail of content to be studied or methods to use. Allow children to learn at their own pace, without the target mentality that plagues our classrooms. And allow management teams to work out how best to support learning in their community. This level of responsibility **must** come with accountability. As in the best private sector organisations with devolved management: decisions need to be justified, based on evidence; mistakes owned up to quickly and lessons learned should be shared. There is a role here for OFSTED, different to its current role which often demoralises teachers and creates vast amounts of unnecessary paperwork.
7.  Make teachers' pay increases dependent on evidence of reflective professional development, subject to a minumum inflation-rate increase.
8.  Allow schools to use the money saved through sharing facilities, teachers, facilities management and school management, to fund more people working directly with children in order to increase the adult-child ratio.
9.  Reduce the gap (both financial and perceptual) between teachers and teaching assistants by putting them on the same, extended, pay scale. Teachers will be expected to treat their support staff as valuable help in the classroom, who often have greater specific expertise than the teacher in charge of that lesson. Movement through the pay scale will depend on evidence of professional development and responsibilities taken on.
10.  Work on the realistic assumption that most teachers work extensively during school holidays and at weekends and build this into the working week by spreading out the holidays so that the breaks are more regular but shorter.

That's my starter for 10\. What would you do?
