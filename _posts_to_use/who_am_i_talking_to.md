# Who am I talking to? {#who-am-i-talking-to}

I was talking to someone earlier today about VLE's, social networks, blogging etc and we talked about a feature of their organisation's in-house VLE that is almost unheard of anywhere else. The VLE in question automatically shows who has read which messages; so that I could post a message in a forum, for example, and see who has read it. Which leads to the question, just because we can, does it mean we should? I mean, just because we can now track who's opened which pages in a particular learning resource, and who's read which messages what does that actually tell you? That they've opened a particular piece of data in a database - not that they've done anything with it. The reason given for this functionality is that it's a data protection issue - the writer must know who has read their messages. But it could be argued that this is invading the reader's privacy (I nearly always ignore a request for read receipts on emails). And anyway, isn't it a bit like bolting the stable door after the horse has gone? It's too late - your post is no longer private if the wrong person has read it. I have two assumptions when I put _anything_ in writing, particularly online:

1.  I can't guarantee that once it's been sent, posted, mailed etc that only the person for whom it was intended might read it.
2.  I can only guarantee that someone has read what I've written by the response they give me.

So, what are the implications of those assumptions?

1.  Be very careful what you write online
2.  Respond, respond, respond
