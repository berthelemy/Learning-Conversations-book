# What sort of professional am I? {#what-sort-of-professional-am-i}

I was in a meeting today where one of the people present said something along the lines of... "... in our world as HR professionals ..." An HR professional? Is that me? I didn't recognise myself in that description at all. I've always (well since I realised I wanted to teach) thought of myself as a "_learning_ professional". Where learning is something you do for its own sake and for the sake of the individual. In my head, HR is something that's done on behalf of the organisation. It's how you manage your Human Resources - just as you might manage paperclips. (Ouch - that's perhaps a bit of a jaundiced view!) So - am I a learning professional - or an HR professional? I suppose it depends on the context, and who I'm talking to. I have to take both viewpoints. Especially as it's normally the client organisation (and often the HR department) that's paying my wages. But, with my learning professional hat on, I'm always on the side of the learner - trying to make sure that what I do will be of real benefit to them as individuals (at the same time as helping the organisation achieve its aims). An interesting balance to work on...
