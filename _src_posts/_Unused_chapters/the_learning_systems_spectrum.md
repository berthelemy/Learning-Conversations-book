# The learning systems spectrum {#the-learning-systems-spectrum}

_Date posted: 15 June 2010_

Thinking about the technology systems we use to support learning, where does yours fit?

I've started the process. Let me know in the comments where you think systems should go on this spectrum.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compliance - top down, "you **must...**" |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Social - bottom up, "have you seen..." |
|  | SAP Learning Solution |  |  | Moodle |  | Wordpress |  |  | Yammer, Socialcast, Facebook, Twitter |

As with any one-dimensional spectrum, we need to be careful not to draw false conclusions, but it's a useful start towards helping organisation gauge their requirements.
