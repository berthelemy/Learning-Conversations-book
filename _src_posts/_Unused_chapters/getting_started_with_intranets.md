# Getting started with intranets {#getting-started-with-intranets}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

[Matt Jukes](http://backpass.org/) is [investigating possibilities for his organisation's intranet](http://backpass.org/2010/12/12/investigating-intranets/) on his blog. There are some good ideas in the comments - including that of using Plone, which I wouldn't have considered (but that's probably because I can't get my head around how it works!) My thoughts pasted below: For really good advice on intranets, I�d always point towards http://www.steptwo.com.au/ � their intranet review toolkit in particular is especially useful. Cloud-based tools like Yammer are great, but you do lose a level of control that many organisations feel they need. If you have an internet-based intranet then you really need to think about authentication and maintaining the user database. It�s not trivial. Intranets inside the network are far easier to manage and maintain (but, in my experience, considerably harder to implement). My gut feel is to start by looking at WordPress + BuddyPress for general publishing and networking (eg. Yammer-type stuff). Sharepoint is good for document management, but, to add anything additional to the out-of-the-box setup is something that can only be done by someone with the ability to run the command line on the server. (At least that�s my experience with Sharepoint 2003 � it may have changed since then).
