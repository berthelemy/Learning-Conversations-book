I'm going to be leading a free session for [Capita Learning & Development](http://www.capita-ld.co.uk/) on Thursday 10 May, 3.30pm at the [Dakota Hotel, Eurocentral](http://www.dakotaeurocentral.co.uk/) which is very close to Glasgow.

The theme of the session will be "The Future Belongs to the Network Aware - the role of RSS and blogs in Learning & Development" and will last approximately 90 minutes with refreshments.

The aim of the session will be to explore why developing your personal network is an essential part of working in the knowledge economy, and will look at the tools that can be used to support that development.

We only have a limited number of places, so you'll need to book in. Please send an email to _louise.beaton @ capita.co.uk_ (you'll need to remove the spaces).

For further information about the session, and to check out some of the resources we'll be using please go to [my wiki page](http://learningconversations.wikispaces.com/glasgow10_05_07).
