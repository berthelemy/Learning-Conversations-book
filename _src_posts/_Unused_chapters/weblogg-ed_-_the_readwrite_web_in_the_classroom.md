> "But the bottom line was that for most, the implementation of these technologies is still a huge mountain to climb. One of the "students" who is an administrator at her school talked about how difficult it was for her teachers to see the potential, to think creatively about the technology. She said that so few of them were current with the tools and that few were able to easily get to the ways they could be applied. And I got the sense that this was true for most of the people in the room. And I know it's true for most schools. We don't do a great job of helping teachers stay abreast of what's happening in technology. **We need to show them more clearly how these technologies can change their practice and their classrooms. RSS feeds, screencasts, podcasts...these are all technologies that we can use to get teachers interested in what's out there and model their use at the same time.**"
