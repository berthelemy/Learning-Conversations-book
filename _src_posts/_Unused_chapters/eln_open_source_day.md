# ELN Open Source day {#eln-open-source-day}

_Date posted: 24 June 2013_

I'm looking forward to the [Elearning Network's Open Source day](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/events/open-source) on July 12th. If you can get to Birmingham that day, and you've got any questions about open source software in learning, then it will be well worth attending. Highlights include:

*   [Mark Aberdour](http://epiclearninggroup.com/uk/about/management/mark-aberdour/) providing an introduction to open source elearning tools
*   [Barry Sampson](http://barrysampson.com/about/) speaking on "Open Source LMS - Wouldya? Couldya? Shouldya?"
*   A panel session with leading practitioners in this area: [Ross McKenzie](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/rossmackenzie), [Ken Ingram](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/ken-ingram/5/9b5/a61), and [Tom Phethean](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tsphethean), as well as Mark Aberdour & Barry Sampson
*   A series of short practical workshops

It's the workshops that I'm most excited about. It'll be a chance to play, to experiment, and to dig into the topics discussed in the morning:

*   Build a responsive learning module using [Xerte Online Toolkit](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xerte/toolkits.aspx)
*   Edit a video with [Mozilla Popcorn](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/)
*   Introduction to [eFront](http://www.efrontlearning.net/)
*   [Moodle](http://moodle.org/) hints and tips
*   Open conversations with the panel

I'm sure we'll also be talking about Kineo's recent press release about their [open source authoring tool project](http://kineo.com/kineo-press-releases/city-a-guilds-and-kineo-announce-open-source-authoring-tool-project.html). The event is kindly sponsored by our friends at [eFront](http://www.efrontlearning.net/), who's LMS is definitely worth a look at if you're wanting something like Moodle but less focussed on formal education.[![](./assets/efront_final_logo_300dpi_sm.png)](./assets/efront_final_logo_300dpi_sm.png)
