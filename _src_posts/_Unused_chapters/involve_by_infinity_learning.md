# Involve by Infinity Learning {#involve-by-infinity-learning}

Some time back I wrote a post about my ideal Learner Support System. Well, I spent a while wandering around the [Learning Technologies exhibition](http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/) last month looking for a system that would meet those needs: It's very difficult to find them. Underneath all the Web 2.0 marketing guff, most of the Learning Management Systems out there are still doing the same old thing - putting management in the middle, rather than the learner. One product that did catch my eye, which I'm investigating further, is [Involve](http://www.infinitylearning.co.uk/web/?q=FirtsLookAtInVoLvE) from [Infinity Learning](http://www.infinitylearning.co.uk/) On first looks it hits some of the key points:

1.  Each piece of content should be individually addressable;
2.  The metadata about each piece of content should be fully searchable;
3.  Users should be able to find content by searching and sorting, by [faceted classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification), and through automated recommendations (other people who used this also used X);
4.  Users should be able to leave comments and ratings against each item of content;
5.  Users should be able to link up with other users with similar interests/learning needs;
6.  It should allow particular groups of users to be targetted with promotions about particular content items;

So far, so good. But, as I said at the conference, without testing how a system works in real life, it's very hard to come to any conclusions... Infinity, are you listening?
