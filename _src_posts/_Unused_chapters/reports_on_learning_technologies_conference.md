Thanks [Jay](http://informl.com/), for putting together this video. I know how long it would have taken... Nice to see people in action, rather than just seeing their photos. I thought it was very interesting how you edited [Donald's](http://donaldhtaylor.wordpress.com/) reaction when you mentioned unmeetings. Personally that's something I'd love to see in the industry, having experienced the recent TeachMeet ( http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/TeachMeet08_London ) at BETT. [youtube]fQaAKUTvPNg[/youtube]
