# Campaign for Effective Elearning {#campaign-for-effective-elearning}

_Date posted: 25 January 2012_

For a long time I have bewailed the poor quality of many of the elearning interventions that are used within the workplace. There are very few examples that I can honestly say would really make a difference - and by that I mean have a **lasting** impact on behaviours or performance. Partly that's to do with the way the interventions are designed, and partly it's down to how they are implemented. [Please note: I am using the word "intervention" deliberately, because I believe that elearning is (or should be) far, far richer than its seemingly accepted definition of a SCORM-packaged bundle of HTML and Flash content.] The [eLearning Network](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/) has today launched their [Campaign for Effective eLearning](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning), which "is waging a campaign to wipe out ineffective, inefficient, flabby elearning". If, as an industry, we can highlight demonstrably effective design and implementation practices, so that they become the accepted standard, we will, hopefully, be one step closer helping our clients make much better use of the online environment than currently. NB. Improved effectiveness does not equate to a higher price. As I hope I demonstrated in my post on [cost-effective video-based learning](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/01/07/highly-cost-effective-video-based?blog=5).[![Campaign for Effective eLearning](./assets/Campaign.gif)](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning)
