# My elevator pitch {#my-elevator-pitch}

_Date posted: 26 January 2012_

It's difficult to explain to people quite what I do at work, so I'm trying to pull some ideas together. Any contributions gladly received!

> [Elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch): ... a short summary used to quickly and simply define a product, service, or organization and its value proposition. The name "elevator pitch" reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes.

How's this for size: I work at the interface of people, organisations and technology - challenging the status quo, and pushing for improvements in all three. .END. I kept wanting to add stuff, which then needed more adding to make it meaningful, so have tried to keep it simple and open. I'd welcome any feedback though.
