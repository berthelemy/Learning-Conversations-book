# Revolution, not Evolution? {#revolution-not-evolution}

_Date posted: 18 February 2008_

[Don Ledingham](http://edubuzz.org/blogs/donsblog) is kicking off his new job in style. He's recently become (Acting )Director of Education and Childrenï¿½s Services for East Lothian Council. His [33 ideas for the secondary school curriculum](http://edubuzz.org/blogs/donsblog/2008/02/17/revolution-not-evolution/) are, each one, pushing a learner-centred, flexible, and up-to-date idea of what school is about. Together they paint a picture of a radical rethink of education. I do hope at least some of these ideas come to fruition. East Lothian will be an exciting place to work in education, and will become a beacon for what's possible.
