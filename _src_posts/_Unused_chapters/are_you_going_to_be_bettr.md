If you need something more informal, and slightly more "on-the-edge" than [BETT](http://www.bettshow.com/) or [Learning Technologies](http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/), then you might be interested in Be Bettr - a conference about "hacking education" on 14th January 2011 at Conway Hall, London.

**Illegal HTML tag removed :** Bettr is a conference about 'hacking education' that is planned to take place during BETT week in London. Inspired by in part by events like Playful and also FOTE it aims to attract an interesting mix of speakers from start-ups, higher education, the media and investors for a day of sharing experiences and learning.

Tickets are only ï¿½20 - so what reason is there not to go? See you there. http://bettr.org/
