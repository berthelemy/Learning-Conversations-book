> As the availability of digital information continues to increase, there is a need for flexible tools that help faculty and students integrate electronic content into their teaching and learning. While numerous applications are available for locating digital information, few tools exist for selecting, organizing and making sense of the information available to us. The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) is an information management application that provides an interactive, concept mapping interface to digital resources accessed via the web, from FEDORA-based digital repositories, ftp servers or local file systems. Using a simple set of tools and a basic visual grammar consisting of nodes and links, faculty and students may map relationships between digital content to capture and communicate concepts and ideas. The resulting content maps can then be shared with others. VUE leverages the cognitive benefits of concept mapping as an interface and information visualization techniques to support the creation of rich resource-based, instructional or research-oriented presentations.

Looks like interesting competition for CmapTools.
