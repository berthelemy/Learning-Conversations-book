Can Interest in Distance Training be Sustained in Corporate Organizations? Zane L. Berge and Adrian A. Kendrick They conclude:

> "the ability to sustain distance training is deeply rooted in the success during the early stages of implementing distance training and the integration of the work and learning environments. Organizations must be proactive and identify those issues that act as barriers to their distance training efforts. Organizations can sustain distance training by understanding were they are in the stages of technological maturity, developing a comprehensive strategic plan, developing a sound technology infrastructure to include the various infrastructure elements, and building strong leaders to champion their initiatives and philosophy of education and learning."
