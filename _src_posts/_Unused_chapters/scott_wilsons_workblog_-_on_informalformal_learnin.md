Scott is referring to [Jay Cross' posting](http://metatime.blogspot.com/2005/04/to-every-thing-turn-turn-turn-there-is.html) on informal & formal learning: "Perhaps there is a Vygotsky-esque 'zone of proximal development' where we can facilitate learners from structured, formal learning, into being able to realize the benefits of unstructured, informal learning?" Jay notes: "Novices learn best through formal learning, for it provides the structure, signposts, and scaffolding a newby lacks. Old hands learn best informally, because they already have foundation knowledge, familiarity, and a framework for understanding. The reverse of these observations is also true. Put novices in totally informal learning situations, and they'll become confused and not get much out of them. Put experienced people in a class, and they will rebel because so much of it is redundant."
