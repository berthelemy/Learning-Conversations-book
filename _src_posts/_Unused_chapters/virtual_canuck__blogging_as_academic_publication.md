Terry Anderson on whether blogs can provide a useful adjunct to more formal academic publication. I would agree with his issue about the permanence or otherwise of blog postings, as compared with published journals. It becomes the author's responsibility rather than the publisher's to keep the posting online. However that's about the only reason I can see for not using blogs (or any other personal webspace) as formal publishing mechanisms. Why do we need the formal peer-review process with maybe one or two peers doing the reviewing, when potentially the whole community could take part in the review?
