Richard Parkin states: Instructional designers need to adopt some marketing thinking I agree totally.with what Richard Parkin is saying here. The only thing I would take issue with is his caricature of training purists:

> Training purists sneer at just-in-time help systems, insisting that people need to know how to do things themselves. They undervalue collaborative learning networks, regarding them as somehow cheating. They fervently believe that adult learners must be led, child-like, through pre-determined learning paths mapped out and controlled by a central authority. They gauge the worth of an employee by his or her ability to survive on a corporate desert island, bereft of books, colleagues, mentors, databases, systems, or communication.

I've not yet met anyone that meets that description... _[Via [Parkin's Lot](http://parkinslot.blogspot.com/2005/05/learning-from-google.html)]_
