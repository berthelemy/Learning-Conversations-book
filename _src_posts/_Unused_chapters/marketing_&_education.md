# Marketing & Education {#marketing-education}

Kathy Sierra brings together [her thoughts](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/marketing_shoul.html) on why Educationalists and Marketers are (or should be) very closely linked. She looks at the marketing theory & practice that teachers could use, and the learning theory & practice that marketers could use. This is something I've been going on about for a while. Mainly in a corporate context ([about learning materials](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2006/11/22/we_want_to_buy_a_learning_module)), but it's also true throughout education/learning. Wherever we're trying to change behaviour we need to understand what will make people want to change.
