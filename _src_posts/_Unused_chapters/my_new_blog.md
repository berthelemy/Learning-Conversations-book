# My new blog {#my-new-blog}

Hi everyone, I'm Jo - Primary Music advisor for Middleshire County Council. I'm hoping this blog will become a useful resource for me, as I collect together ideas from around the county and elsewhere to support Music teaching & learning. I particularly want to focus on the Creative Curriculum - and how we can link together with other parts of the curriculum to enhance basic skills through creative learning. So - this is going to be a journey of discovery for me - and hopefully for anyone else reading this. Please feel free to comment on the posts. It would be great if this could become a conversation.
