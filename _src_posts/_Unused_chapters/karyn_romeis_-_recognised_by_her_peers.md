# Karyn Romeis - recognised by her peers {#karyn-romeis-recognised-by-her-peers}

_Date posted: 23 September 2007_

The [Learning Technologies conference/exhibition/magazine](http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/index.cfm) in the UK is probably one of the most relevant media organisations for the people I work with. I'm really pleased that they've put Karyn Romeis as their [blog of the week](http://learningtechnologiesconference.wordpress.com/2007/09/21/blog-of-the-week-10-karyn-romeis/). Everything they say about Karyn's blog is true. Her's is one of the few blogs I make a point of reading whenever there's something new on it. And that's not just because I work with her - but because it's actually interesting to read. So, well done Karyn!
