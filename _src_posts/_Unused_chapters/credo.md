# Credo {#credo}

Credo... I believe... I'm the sort of person that always has to go back to first principles, so that I understand why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'll take as read the [Apostle's Creed](http://anglicansonline.org/basics/apostles.html), (which I'm happy to debate, but unlikely to change), but what about what I believe in terms of learning and education? Where do I stand at the moment? On what am I basing the decisions I make about teaching & learning. (And remember these are entirely my own views, and not representative of any organisation with which I'm affiliated). I've started trying to work this out on a wikispace. It's not the sort of thing I can do entirely on my own. There needs to be debate and refining if we're to end up with a coherent set of principles & beliefs, that can act as the foundations for our actions. (Or should it be a personal, post-modern set of statements? Different for everyone?) It doesn't need to be an essay. Just a set of well-written, succinct, statements - setting out a position.
