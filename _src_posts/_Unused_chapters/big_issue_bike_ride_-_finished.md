Over Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week, along with 140 other people, I cycled a total of 240 miles from London to Paris. Our team of Capita colleagues raised over �5000 for the Big Issue, and we were that over �200,000 has been raised overall. It was the biggest fund raising event the [Big Issue Foundation](http://www.bigissue.com/) has ever done. The whole thing was professionally run with excellent support teams with all the food and drink we needed, along with spare parts, tools, mechanics and medics! Thanks to everyone who sponsored me for their support. You can find a list of my corporate sponsors on the [home page of the Learning Conversations site](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/). And if you want proof that we made it to Paris:![Mark at La Tour Eiffel](./assets/mark_eifel_cropped.png)
