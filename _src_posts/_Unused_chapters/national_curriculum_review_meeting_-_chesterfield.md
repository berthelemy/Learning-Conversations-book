There are distinct parallels with the work I do in the corporate sector, and those in the education sector (which I inhabited as a teacher and product consultant for many years). So, I keep well-connected with my education colleagues, and have had many long discussions about the direction education is going in the UK and the rest of the world. It's time for those discussions to come out into the open. Rather than just talking about stuff, we've now got the opportunity to have a say directly into government. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Secretary of State for Education, has recently announced a review of the primary and secondary National Curriculum in England. As part of this review the Department for Education has issued a [vidence](http://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/index.cfm?action=consultationDetails&consultationId=1730&external=no&menu=1) asking for opinions and evidence that will start a national debate about what is taught in the schools of England. As an educational professional, school governor, policy maker, parent, carer, learner in England the above review affects you and the children under your care. If you are an employer in England it also affects you. In fact it's difficult to think of anybody that the outcome of this review does not touch in some way.

### How will you respond? {#how-will-you-respond}

If you live anywhere near (or not so near) Chesterfield, you will be very welcome at an open meeting on the evening of 3rd March 2011. It will be an evening of discussion and debate about what should be taught in our schools. The purpose of this event is to engage participants in a discussion that will explore differing points of view about existing education provision and how it may be improved to encourage informed responses to the DfE's call. Each of our speakers will talk for 5-10 minutes about their personal position on what should be taught in our schools. This will be interspersed with some short videos and open discussion focussed on a number of key questions. The evening will allow you to debate with people who may have a differing viewpoint from your own. We hope that new conversations will start, new opinions form and you will gain a better understanding of views that may be counter to your own.
