# Being Creative in a Digital World {#being-creative-in-a-digital-world}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

This post is aimed at participants in my forthcoming workshop on Creative Thinking in a Digital World - please contact me if you'd like me to run a similar workshop for your teams.

### Prework exercises {#prework-exercises}

Before the workshop, you will need to have watched at least one of the two videos below. They are both from the same event - a lecture by [Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/); the first is an abridged, 11 minute version of the talk, with supporting animations. The second is the entire 55 minute talk.

While you are watching the video consider:

1.  What do we mean by creativity?
2.  What is divergent thinking?
3.  Why is collaboration important for creative thought?

### During the workshop {#during-the-workshop}

The workshop is designed to as interactive and practical half-day workshop which will allow you to develop ways in which you can use the digital space to stimulate creativity, generate ideas, solve problems and learn.

We will explore how to create a **personal learning network** through which you can remain current, stimulate new ideas and adapt rapidly.

This will focus on the use of blogs, RSS feeds, Twitter, Facebook and, in particular, the way mobile devices enable us to remain connected at all times.

We will then identify a number of **tools** that can support ideas generation, discussion and collaboration.

This will focus on a range of tool-types including:

*   [Mind-mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) / [Concept-mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map)
*   [Shared documents](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRqUE6IHTEA)
*   [Desktop sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_sharing) / [Whiteboarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteboarding)
*   [Instant messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging)
*   [Enterprise micro-blogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging)

You will leave with a set of tools to explore, along with ideas on when and where they might be useful, and the implications of using them.

Finally we will explore how to use **digital media** to find and evaluate information, collaborate more effectively, create ideas and communicate.

We will look at questions such as:

*   How do you know whether something is worth buying?
*   How do you know if information is valid, true, current and unbiased?
*   What tools or websites are available that will stimulate creative thinking? (eg. Flickr, Animoto)
*   What should I consider if I'm using online tools? (Issues such as copyright, lack of visual cues etc)

If you have any questions or comments in advance of the workshop, please post them as "feedback" to this post.
