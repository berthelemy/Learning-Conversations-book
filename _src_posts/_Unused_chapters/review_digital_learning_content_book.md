# Review: Digital Learning Content book {#review-digital-learning-content-book}

_Date posted: 6 September 2012_

I recently reviewed Clive Shepherd's book "[Digital Learning Content - a designer's guide](http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/digital-learning-content-designers.html)" on the [Wyver Solutions blog](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/2012/09/06/review-digital-learning-content-a-designers-guide/). In summary:

> This is a book I would recommend to anyone who is involved with creating digital learning materials. Even if youï¿½ve been around the industry for a while there will be ideas to pick up. It would be an ideal sourcebook for any training course for new designers, and could even stimulate quite a few heated discussions amongst established design teams!
