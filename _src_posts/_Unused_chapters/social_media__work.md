# Social media @ work {#social-media-work}

_Date posted: 28 June 2011_

This is a great little video from [Red Sky Vision](http://www.redskyvision.com/), via [Jane Hart](http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2011/06/social-media-work-video.html).

[Social Media @ Work](http://vimeo.com/25234403) from [Red Sky Vision](http://vimeo.com/user6093018) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).

From the blurb:

> There is disconnect between how immersed and digitally connected employees are outside of the workplace, and how their internal communications are being delivered. On the ground, employees are still posting printed communications on the water cooler when they can be engaged, led and informed via the latest digital channel.

And a great quote from the video:

> "Organisations are inherently risk averse. My grandfather ran a business where he didn't want everybody having a telephone. He was afraid they'd spend all day talking to their mother."

Sounds silly now, doesn't it. Just as it will sound silly in a few years when we talk about Facebook, Twitter et al being blocked, or about not having organisation-specific social media tools.

> Approximately 2/3 of corporate intranets now have some form of social media capability.
