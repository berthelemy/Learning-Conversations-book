Ali Mesher is a new blogger, beginning to experiment with the internet and how it can support her coaching business. Yet in her first post she goes to the heart of what blogging means to a lot of people:

> As I sit to write some thoughts on this blog, I automatically have the thought that what I write will be no good, or boring or insignificant, or of little use to anyone. 'Whose going to read it anyway' immediately comes up as a barrier to even starting, closely followed by 'what is the purpose of the blog?' Is it to engage new clients, to inspire and motivate? to touch someones heart who might be browsing on the web? Do you know what I'm not sure what its purpose is-I am writing into the unknown, with no attachment or expectation of what might come back, or what interest it might generate. I do notice though that when I write I feel very content, very focused and I suppose I get into that zone that athletes might call flow. It's something I love to do, it helps me clarify my thoughts, my state, my mood, it helps me to be more aware of what I am doing, and why I am doing it. Even if I don't know the answers to my own questions the process moves me a little nearer to that point of clarity and with clarity comes the motivation to act, to move forward towards a goal, sure of it's intention and fully assured of its inspiration. So I write this first entry on this blog unsure of my goal in having a blog-perhaps its not a marketing tool, a communication tool, perhaps its not so that I can reach you but so that I can really reach me!
