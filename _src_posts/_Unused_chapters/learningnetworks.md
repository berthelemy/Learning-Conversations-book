As always, George Siemens has provided a stimulating and thought-provoking presentation. Questions for me: How do we interpret this thinking about learning networks inside organisations where learning is seen as formal (hierarchical?) programmes? How can we explain the concepts of learning networks and informal learning in terms that will be understood throughout the organisation?
