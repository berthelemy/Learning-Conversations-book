# Finding research on workplace learning {#finding-research-on-workplace-learning}

Reading the latest issue of [ALT-J](http://www.alt.ac.uk/alt_j.html) (the peer-reviewed journal of the Association for Learning Technology), you could be forgiven for thinking that Learning Technology is only being used in the formal education system (ie. primary through to tertiary), and not at all in the workplace. So I raised this question with other ALT members. The answers that came back proved that my worries were unfounded. Here's a summary of places where you can find research on workplace learning:

*   [Towards Maturity](http://www.towardsmaturity.org/) - not academic, but worthwhile nonetheless, and the reports are free to download.
*   [Impact: Journal of Applied Research in Workplace E-learning](http://journal.elnet.com.au/index.php?journal=impact) - looks like exactly what I was looking for. It's free to register and papers are licensed under Creative Commons.
*   [Mature](http://mature-ip.eu/) - an EU project looking at community driven approaches to learning in the workplace. Just what I need right now!

There were a few other suggestions, but they didn't really fit the bill. I was looking for research evidence that I could use to inform my daily practice. At the moment, Impact looks most useful.
