## Section 2: Learning Systems {#section-2-learning-systems}

Systems are good. They take current best practices and make them replicable across many contexts.In the context of learning, we systematise at our peril. Effective learning has too so many variables.Likewise, we run the risk of failing when our systems impose new practices on top of ones that already working.Yet systems can still help. Not around learning as a complete process, but to support specific parts of the process: content delivery, timetabling of resources, assessments and surveys, breaking down silos, improving communication etcThe best systems are simple and flexible. Take Twitter for example. As simple as it can be, yet used in many different ways through its API.This section will focus on computer-based systems, as these are most prevalent today. But you could adapt some of the ideas in it when trying to implement any new way of doing things.
