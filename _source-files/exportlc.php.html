<br>
He compares this to the current focus on learning objects, federated searches, learning design &amp; learning management systems, and how these provide an "inadequate model" for learning online.<br>
<br>
The only issue I have here, is that the <a href="http://www.munimall.net/index.nclk">Munimall </a>illustration he gives, of an "open-ended learning environment", does not seem to live up to this description. In fact, its use of WebCT to provide online courses and classes seems to illustrate everything he is trying to move away from.</div><h1>Viewing RSS feeds on our home page</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 November 2004</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://itde.vccs.edu/rss2js/build.php">http://itde.vccs.edu/rss2js/build.php</a></p><p>The feed from our blogs is created using the tool hosted by the Virginia Community College System.

Interesting that he treats learning objects as pretty much any interaction that can take place online: learner-learner, learner-content &amp; learner-teacher.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>online components, which are becoming known as learning objects, include text; electronic mail, discussion boards, chat utilities, voice over Internet protocol, and instant messaging; synchronous audio; video clips; interactive activities, simulations, and games; self-grading exercises, quizzes, and examinations; and Web sites.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Kaplan provides a useful set of suggestions to help online courses (of whatever complexion) to work, including a list of pre-course documentation, how to get "faculty" buy-in &amp; key elements of sound pedagogy.</div><h1>IMPLEMENTING THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES: Technology as Lever</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.tltgroup.org/programs/seven.html">http://www.tltgroup.org/programs/seven.html</a></p>This could prove useful as a measure against which to develop online courses.<br>
<br>
The 7 principles are:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Encourage contacts between students and faculty.</li><br>
  <li>Develop reciprocity and cooperation among students.</li><br>
  <li>Use active learning techniques.</li><br>
  <li>Give prompt feedback.</li><br>
  <li>Emphasize time on task.</li><br>
  <li>Communicate high expectations.</li><br>
  <li>Respect diverse talents and ways of learning.</li><br>

<br>
<blockquote>As you begin to formulate your instructional strategy, it may be helpful to use R. Gagne's "nine events of instruction" as an organizational tool. Gagne outlined a process of learning that includes the following nine events:<br>
<br>
    * Gain attention<br>
    * Inform learners of objectives<br>
    * Stimulate recall of prior learning<br>
    * Present the content<br>
    * Provide learner guidance<br>
    * Elicit learning/practice<br>
    * Provide feedback<br>
    * Assess learning<br>

<blockquote><strong>What is needed in a Learning Environment?</strong><br>
<br>
Any learning environment should:<br>
<br>
    * Have a place for learner expression (blog/portfolio)<br>
    * Have a place for content interaction (LMS' have this)<br>
    * Have a place to connect with other learners (discussion forum - LMS' have this)<br>
    * Have a place to connect the thoughts of other learners in a personal, meaningful way - i.e. using RSS and then brought back into the "learner expression tool"<br>
    * Have a place to dialogue with the instructor (email, VoIP, etc. - webct has some of this)<br>
    * Have a place to dialogue with gurus (apprentice) - the heart of online communities is the mess of varying skills and expertise. Gurus are people currently in industry or established practitioners of the organizing theme of the community. LMS limit the interaction to learner and instructor.<br>
    * Have a place for learning artifacts of those who've gone before - i.e. content management capabilities accessible and managed by the learner. Tools like Furl, del.icio.us are examples of personal knowledge management (PKM) tools.<br>
    * Be modularized so additional functionality and tools can be added based on what learners want or need...a bricolage of course tools - based on open standards - allow for incorporation of new approaches as needed.<br>

<br>
<a href="http://cde.athabascau.ca/online_book/ch7.html">Chapter 7: The development of online courses.</a> is particularly useful.<br>
<br>
My favourite quote from the book is in Chapter 2 (It's actually a quote from an earlier work):<br>
<blockquote>Sufficient levels of deep and meaningful learning can be developed, as long as one of the three forms of interaction (student-teacher; student-student; student-content) is at very high levels. The other two may be offered at minimal levels or even eliminated without degrading the educational experience. (Anderson, 2002)</blockquote><br>

<br>
For learners to achieve the learning that you hope for, then they need to interact with the content of the learning - and do something with it.<br>
<br>
That could mean asking questions of people, creating materials based on what they've read, carrying out simulated activities, or practice on the job, with support.</div><h1>BETT Learning Platform White Paper</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 November 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://home.capitaes.co.uk/LearningPlatform/Downloads/index.asp">http://home.capitaes.co.uk/LearningPlatform/Downloads/index.asp</a></p>This White Paper (click on the link above then go to the section headed White Papers) formed the basis of my presentations at BETT 2004.<br>

He argues that knowledge about good teaching practice will only spread around the system quickly by schools and teachers linking together into 'innovation networks' - run by teachers for teachers as a shared professional resource over which all have ownership.</blockquote><br>
<br>
David Hargreaves discusses innovation and transformation in schools, and examines how ICT, &amp; networks in particular, can aid the transformation process by rapidly spreading best practice.<br>
<br>
He uses examples of Amazon, epinions.com and Napster to demonstrate how peer-to-peer networks and referrals can support rapid exchange of knowledge, and compares teachers to "hackers" in the open-source software movement; where a hacker is...<br>
<br>
<blockquote>‘an enthusiast, an artist, a tinkerer, a problem solver, and  expert’.</blockquote><br>
<br>
The open-source software movement works on the basis of a large number of people working on the same problem. Hargreaves argues that schools may transform and innovate using a similar model.<br>

<br>
<blockquote>The starting point of connectivism is the individual. Personal knowledge is comprised of a network, which feeds into organizations and institutions, which in turn feed back into the network, and then continue to provide learning to individual. This cycle of knowledge development (personal to network to organization) allows learners to remain current in their field through the connections they have formed.</blockquote></div><h1>InfoWorld: The network is the blog: December 10, 2004: By Jon Udell : APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT : APPLICATIONS : BUSINESS : DATA_MANAGEMENT : WEB_SERVICES</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 December 2004</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/12/10/50OPstrategic_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/12/10/50OPstrategic_1.html</a></p>A short article - but a useful summary of how blogs can support information management.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Just as telephones are meaningful only when connected to the telephone network, so blogs are meaningful only when connected to the blog network. Both are carriers of human communication, but where the telephone network is essentially fixed -- at least for now, until VoIP softens its structure -- the blog network is malleable and is shaped by our use of it. It’s more like a nervous system than a computer network, and for good reason.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
The blog network is made of people. We are the nodes, actively filtering and retransmitting knowledge. Clearly this architecture can help manage the glut of information. More subtly, it can also help ensure that no vital inputs are suppressed because nobody has to rely on a single source. If one of the feeds I monitor doesn’t react to some event in a given domain, another probably will. When they all react, I know it was an especially important event. </blockquote></div><h1>LC Annual E-Learning Trends 2004</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 December 2004</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.learningcircuits.org/2004/nov2004/LC_Trends_2004.htm">http://www.learningcircuits.org/2004/nov2004/LC_Trends_2004.htm</a></p>Good to see that people are starting to realise that you can't just push out a new learning programme or a new system and expect people to embrace it...<br>
<br>
<blockquote>What can we conclude from this data? It seems as though the general e-learning practitioner is getting smarter and more specific about what he or she does. They’re defining e-learning in narrower terms--to cover the actual learning experiences (i.e., virtual classrooms, simulations, e-courseware) rather than the infrastructure systems that their organizations use to develop and support e-learning (i.e., LMS, LCMS, authoring tools).<br>
<br>
In addition, an increasing number of employees and managers are not only aware of e-learning, but also are interested in using it. More important, even though technology and cost issues ranked as their highest concerns, managers are conscious of the culture issues involved in implementing a successful e-learning strategy.</blockquote></div><h1>Nine Rules for Good Technology - Robin Good' Sharewood Tidings</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 December 2004</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/2004/04/04/nine_rules_for_good_technology.htm">http://www.masternewmedia.org/2004/04/04/nine_rules_for_good_technology.htm</a></p>Useful analysis of what makes technology good and thus usable and ubiqitous.</div><h1>The Learning Marketplace: Meaning, Metadata and Content Syndication in the Learning Object Economy, by Stephen Downes</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 December 2004</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.downes.ca/files/book3.htm">http://www.downes.ca/files/book3.htm</a></p>A 300-odd page book that contains a lot of Stephen's recent thinking.<br>

But from the website it looks like it might be the ideal way of creating and sharing concept maps (aka knowledge maps).<br>

It's not as tree-oriented as a Mind Map (see: <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">FreeMind</a>)<br>

<blockquote>Compendium is the semantic hypertext concept mapping tool at the heart of the Compendium methodology.

Concept maps are very different from the tree-like structures of Mind Maps. They enable interconnections to be made and visualised between any item.<br>

<br>
The difficulty lies in knowing where to stop and, when all the interrelationships are made, then navigating around the map.<br>
<br>
The CMAP tools can save as XTM XML (a standard for topic maps) which can then be transformed into Keygraph XML by the command line tool <a href="http://www.maths.jyu.fi/~minurmin/projekti/ohjelmistot/xcm2kg/doc/xcm2kg_manual.html">xcm2kg </a> which can then be displayed in a rather excellent java applet (which can be explored, rotated and zoomed). <a href="http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/MBmaps/map.php.htm" target="_blank">Have a play and see</a>.</div><h1>Auricle</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 January 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/dacs/cdntl/pMachine/morriblog_more.php?id=370_0_4_0_M">http://www.bath.ac.uk/dacs/cdntl/pMachine/morriblog_more.php?id=370_0_4_0_M</a></p>Interesting review of Moodle in use from Bath University.<br>
<br>
This is the most telling comment:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Auricle readers will undoubtedly have noticed that although Moodle is in this article's title it has hardly been mentioned. One of Moodle's greatest strengths is that it appears not to get in the way of designing a course to suit what the developers want rather than have to shoe horn it into an environment that substantially changes how the course is delivered. I'm not saying Moodle does not have its limitations, but it largely does what it says on the box (if it had one:) If you wish to deliver courses that support a student centred approach then this is what it does. The software installation does not raise any problems and customisation, as mentioned earlier, is straightforward, even for people with limited programming experience. The support from the wider Moodle community is quite exceptional with answers to most of the questions to be found in the extensive forums that exist at the moodle Web site. Questions posted to the forums often produce responses within hours of it going live.</blockquote></div><h1>EduSite: Teemu Leinonen: E-learning is dead.

<br>
<blockquote>The current National Curriculum seems to be little different to that of the 1960s, which prepared children for a world in which a job was for life. The time has surely come to recognise that if we are to educate effectively for the world of tomorrow then we will need to reject current curriculum constraint and think again. In this century successful individuals will need a comprehensive and global education in order to become effective citizens. They will need flexible approaches to learning, to be able to apply skills and knowledge flexibly and be able to manage information and situations. When did we actually teach children how to learn and how to think? Are we not guilty of spoon-feeding learners in order to get them through the various hoops at the end of each Key Stage and are thereby failing to encourage them to take full responsibility for their own learning? Learning to learn, learning to think and "turning out people who love learning so much, and who learn so well, that they will learn whatever needs to be learnt" (Holt, 1965) must become the core of the curriculum.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Their "alternative curriculum" seems to mirror that adopted by <a href="http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=5&amp;title=tasmania_s_essential_learning&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Tasmania</a><br>

Experts can construct knowledge models of their domains directly and interatively in a collaborative manner or actively participate in assisted knowledge elicitation processes for facilitating knowledge capture and sharing, by producing representations that are easily understood by others. Construction of concept maps are often useful in the context of specific questions for which answers are sought or some situation or event that is attempted to be understood through the organization of knowledge in the form of a concept map.</blockquote></div><h1>Mind Maps, Mind Mapping and Drawing Mind Maps from Mind Tools</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 February 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/mindmaps.html">http://www.mindtools.com/mindmaps.html</a></p>Some useful information on how to improve mind mapping.</div><h1>Knowledge Mapping</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 February 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.smithweaversmith.com/knowledg2.htm">http://www.smithweaversmith.com/knowledg2.htm</a></p>Useful checklist on what is and how to do knowledge mapping.</div><h1>Stakeholder interviews as K mapping</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 February 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_interviews/">http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_interviews/</a></p><blockquote>Stakeholder interviews are a simple, but very effective mechanism for gaining an understanding of an organisation, and for identifying staff needs.

While numerous applications are available for locating digital information, few tools exist for selecting, organizing and making sense of the information available to us. The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) is an information management application that provides an interactive, concept mapping interface to digital resources accessed via the web, from FEDORA-based digital repositories, ftp servers or local file systems. Using a simple set of tools and a basic visual grammar consisting of nodes and links, faculty and students may map relationships between digital content to capture and communicate concepts and ideas. The resulting content maps can then be shared with others. VUE leverages the cognitive benefits of concept mapping as an interface and information visualization techniques to support the creation of rich resource-based, instructional or research-oriented presentations.</blockquote><br>

Zane L. Berge and Adrian A. Kendrick<br>
<br>
They conclude:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"the ability to sustain distance training is deeply rooted in the success during the early stages of implementing distance training and the integration of the work and learning environments.<br>
<br>
Organizations must be proactive and identify those issues that act as barriers to their distance training efforts. Organizations can sustain distance training by understanding were they are in the stages of technological maturity, developing a comprehensive strategic plan, developing a sound technology infrastructure to include the various infrastructure elements, and building strong leaders to champion their initiatives and philosophy of education and learning."</blockquote></div><h1>Connectivism &amp; K-12</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 March 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>(This is a copy of a posting I made on the <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/">Connectivism</a> discussion forum.)<br>
<br>
I've just been listening to George Siemen's <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/001956.html">presentation &amp; discussion about Connectivism</a>, and feel that he's selling it somewhat short in discounting its use in K-12 education (or primary &amp; secondary as we call it in the UK). I agree, it's totally suited to lifelong learning in the workplace, but the only reason it doesn't fit K-12 at the moment is because the curriculum models adopted by most countries do not map well to the needs of the lifelong learner.<br>
<br>
Most curriculum models assume, as George did, that children are like buckets to be filled up with knowledge - and it's not until they've got a certain amount of knowledge that they become able to be self-evaluating learners, capable of dialogue.<br>
<br>
Most early years practitioners, would I believe, disagree violently with that understanding of young children. Children learn more rapidly than adults by making, breaking &amp; changing connections. Not necessarily using technology as there are so many connections to be made locally without needing technology to support them.<br>
<br>
There is a significant move away from the "knowledge" curriculum model for schools, towards one that focusses on learning how to learn - which fits Connectivism like a glove. <a href="http://www.education.tas.gov.au/ocll/publications/default.htm">Tasmania</a> has taken on that curriculum model wholesale, and both the <a href="http://www.thersa.org/newcurriculum/">Royal Society of Arts</a> and the <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/10969.html">Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority</a> in the UK are exploring it in detail. It also ties in with the work being done by <a href="http://www.nestafuturelab.org/research/reviews/ts19.htm">NESTA</a>.<br>
<br>
Novak's work on Concept Maps in K-12 maybe doesn't go quite as far as the Connectivism theory, but it does illustrate a different way of approaching education using Connectivist ideals, focussing on the self-evaluation of learning:<br>
<a href="http://cmc.ihmc.us/papers/cmc2004-285.pdf">http://cmc.ihmc.us/papers/cmc2004-285.pdf</a>).<br>
<br>
He talks about learning as being actuated knowledge, making the point that it's much easier to actuate knowledge in the workplace than in an educational institution (of whatever type). Which comes back to the question, are our educational institutions in their current form a suitable environment for learning in the connected age? Which then leads to the higher question (as being addressed by the institutions above), what do we want people to gain from our educational institutions?<br>
<br>
Connectivism, combined with changes to the curriculum and changes in our expectations of learning institutions will, I'm sure be a powerful model for learning. And I, for one, would jump at the chance to implement it in a K-12 school. </div><h1>Connectivism Blog</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 March 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/blog">http://www.connectivism.ca/blog</a></p><blockquote>We can't stand alone on our own knowledge. We have to aggregate with other nodes (people, content, knowledge) in order to meet the challenges of a complex information climate. Unfortunately, education (K-12, higher and corporate) are built on the model that we can fit what is important into one person's head. The network becomes valuable once we combine and connect separate nodes of knowledge.</blockquote><br>

(delusions of grandeur raising their ugly head here) of a learning environment where all people are equal. There is no difference between the rights of teachers and those of learners. Anyone can draw people in to their "group" to work on activities of their choice. Resources can be brought in to support those activities from inside the system (maybe the products of activities) or from outside (using RSS?). It takes a similar approach to Amazon where the system suggests resources based on the user's history &amp; what other people in similar contexts have used and thought valuable. Resources can also include people, so that the system can recommend people to bring into the group based on the other resources that have been selected or the activities chosen. The products of activities can be kept private to the group, to the system, or published externally, again using RSS.<br>
<br>
I think this would be ideal as a corporate intranet, an informal learning system, and maybe (?) as an academic system (with extra modules (or links in to CiteULike) to support citing of resources and authentication for subscription-based resources).<br>
<br>
It doesn't go as far as Stephen Downes' model of a distributed system as I can't yet see how you can do away with some sort of centralised system to support the "institution". But the use of RSS means that you don't have to be working in the system to contribute to it.<br>
<br>
It does support the Connectivist model of education being proposed by George Siemens - supporting the ability to make &amp; change connections rapidly.<br>
<br>
The only system out there that is going someway there is Tomoye's Simplify (<a href="http://www.tomoye.com/ourproducts/productdemo.htm">http://www.tomoye.com/ourproducts/productdemo.htm</a>), but it's still very much a "managed" system. My vision is to put the learners back in control of their own learning - but when they are ready for it - that's where I came in. This is the middle ground; initially the learning leaders will be setting things up, but with the aim of pushing out that responsibility as quickly as possible to the learners.</div><h1>Parkin's Lot: Is E-Learning Missing the Point?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 March 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://parkinslot.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-e-learning-missing-point.html">http://parkinslot.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-e-learning-missing-point.html</a></p><blockquote>While every corporate university needs its library of knowledge and self-paced courses, it can actively add huge value by embracing the power of the web as a catalyst for knowledge-cultivation, making every employee both a coach and a learner, continuously. </blockquote><br>

The first generation of SNS applications has done much to justify the need for such services, as well as identified what must be improved in order to make the technology more useful. A unification of effort amongst the competing SNS applications is needed, as is a movement towards support for open protocols for access to its services and information.

<blockquote>According to Senge: At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind –from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something ‘out there’ to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience. A learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. And how they can change it.</blockquote><br>

<br>
Hi Dave,<br>
<br>
Your ideas seem to match those of Graham Atwell (http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/weblog.entries/5204214444) and also my own (http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=5&amp;title=i_have_a_dream&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1).<br>
<br>
I have a question though: do you have a vision where multiple ELGG installations will be able to communicate with each other? This would then bring us into the realm of distributed learning environments as envisaged by Stephen Downes - where I can put a search into my personal learning landscape and it would link me up with appropriate people &amp; ideas from across a range of ELGG's. As you say, strong permissions will be key.</div><h1>Knowledge-at-work: Personal learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 April 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/03/personal_learni.html">http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/03/personal_learni.html</a></p>"<blockquote>The key to learning is not the medium nor the message, it is the quality of the dialog with your peers that really matters."</blockquote><br>
<br>
This article echos where my thinking is going - that we need to make better use of the informal opportunities for learning, rather than focus on planned learning interventions.</div><h1>Knowledge-at-work: Cyclic Cmaps</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 April 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/03/cyclic_cmaps.html">http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/03/cyclic_cmaps.html</a></p>This reference to a paper that discusses cyclic cmaps in depth makes the point that "Top-down directionality in a concept map robs us of important insights and fails to portray an important class of relationships. In a way, this is similar to the arc only restriction of mind mapping."<br>
<br>
I would tend to agree, but the thing I've also been learning about Cmaps and MindMaps is that, to make them meaningful takes an awful lot of work. However more is learnt through the process of giving the maps meaning than is contained in the maps themselves.</div><h1>Knowledge-at-work: Concept mapping revisited</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 April 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/02/concept_mapping.html">http://denham.typepad.com/km/2005/02/concept_mapping.html</a></p>A short introduction to Concept Mapping from Denham Grey.<br>
<br>
I agree with one of the comments which states: " we have still to improve the way we use [concept maps] because they are ONLY the mirror of our thoughts at a given instant." We need some way of creating dynamic concept maps... this is where it perhaps links with ELGG &amp; Stephen Downes' ideas about user-based metadata.</div><h1>Enterprise Systems | The Invisibility of Knowledge Work</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 April 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.esj.com/enterprise/article.aspx?EditorialsID=1327">http://www.esj.com/enterprise/article.aspx?EditorialsID=1327</a></p><blockquote>"In moving to e-mail, word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation tools, maintaining (preserving?) visibility of your knowledge work (at both the individual and workgroup level) requires conscious effort.

<br>
The main thing this article suggests to help make knowledge work more visible is to make filenames &amp; email subject lines more explicit in their descriptions of where in the creation process the file comes.<br>
<br>
I would suggest it would be better to post files along with metadata about the file - perhaps using a forum, blog, or project management system (eg. dotproject). That way a dated record of the work done can be kept.</div><h1>Mind Map of informal learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 April 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.informallearn.com/">http://www.informallearn.com/</a></p>Developed by Jay Cross as the plan for a forthcoming book.

<br>
1. Bill Gates Says High Schools Are "Obsolete": Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft recently gave an incredibly powerful speech about the shortcomings and challenges of United States high schools.  Here are a few of his key points and worries:<br>
<br>
* "By obsolete, I don't just mean that our high schools are broken, flawed and under-funded - though a case could be made for everyone of those points.  By obsolete, I mean that our high schools - even when they are working as designed - cannot teach our kids what they need to know today."<br>
* "Training the workforce of tomorrow with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about today's computers on a 50 year old mainframe."<br>
* "Only 1/3 of our students graduate from high school ready for college, work and citizenship."<br>
* Gates suggests 3 new "R"'s for redesigned high schools:  Rigor, Relevance and Relationships (with mentoring adults).<br>
* Gates is urging, and backing these perspectives with grants from his foundation of $1 Billion, focusing on smaller schools, different forms of measurement and greater commitment to getting ALL students across the finish line in terms of readiness for college, work and citizenship.<br>

One of the "students" who is an administrator at her school talked about how difficult it was for her teachers to see the potential, to think creatively about the technology. She said that so few of them were current with the tools and that few were able to easily get to the ways they could be applied. And I got the sense that this was true for most of the people in the room. And I know it's true for most schools. We don't do a great job of helping teachers stay abreast of what's happening in technology. <b>We need to show them more clearly how these technologies can change their practice and their classrooms. RSS feeds, screencasts, podcasts...these are all technologies that we can use to get teachers interested in what's out there and model their use at the same time.</b>"</blockquote><br>

I agree totally.with what Richard Parkin is saying here. The only thing I would take issue with is his caricature of training purists:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Training purists sneer at just-in-time help systems, insisting that people need to know how to do things themselves. They undervalue collaborative learning networks, regarding them as somehow cheating. They fervently believe that adult learners must be led, child-like, through pre-determined learning paths mapped out and controlled by a central authority. They gauge the worth of an employee by his or her ability to survive on a corporate desert island, bereft of books, colleagues, mentors, databases, systems, or communication.</blockquote><br>

<br>
A good analysis of the state of play of large implementations of e-learning.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Large-scale e-learning can be achieved, although it is not as simple or as cost-effective as once imagined. The models above demonstrate what a broad umbrella term %u2018e-learning%u2019 is, since it can refer to a range of learning experiences%u2014from watching a 2 minute animation to studying a nine months master%u2019s course based on constructivist principles. If one considers not just large-scale implementations, then the term also encompasses small courses, blended courses, informal learning through dialogue, and so forth. For this reason, it may not be a useful term as it focuses on the medium. Given such a variety of learning experience, this is perhaps the least significant factor. A normal campus-based undergraduate lecture class has more in common with the expert-plus-part-time-support model than this does with peer-supported- community model, say. So, to group them all simply as e-learning may not be helpful. An alternative approach may be to group learning experiences according to pedagogy.</blockquote></div><h1>Interview with Etienne Wenger on Communities of Practice %u2014 Knowledge Lab</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 June 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.knowledgelab.dk/now/e-portfolio/etienne_wenger">http://www.knowledgelab.dk/now/e-portfolio/etienne_wenger</a></p>This interview (using streaming flash video - wow!), puts the theoretical basis into using communities of practice, and perhaps informal learning ideas, within the corporate environment</div><h1>Interview with Ben Werdmuller on "learning landscapes" and the Elgg-project %u2014 Knowledge Lab</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 June 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.knowledgelab.dk/now/e-portfolio/ben_werdmuller">http://www.knowledgelab.dk/now/e-portfolio/ben_werdmuller</a></p>Nothing much new here if you've been following the Elgg developments (<a href="http://elgg.net/">http://elgg.net</a>), but interesting anyway.</div><h1>Grammar of the Internet</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 June 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.novemberlearning.com/Default.aspx?tabid=159&amp;action=cat&amp;lcl=2&amp;parentID=56">http://www.novemberlearning.com/Default.aspx?tabid=159&amp;action=cat&amp;lcl=2&amp;parentID=56</a></p>Excellent resource for schools and teacher CPD from Alan November.<br>

It uses the <a href="http://loudblog.de/">loudblog </a>software to manage the podcasts. This was an absolute doddle to install and set up. The only hiccup came because my host (Godsweb) has a 2Mb limit on file uploads, which means that I have to use ftp to get the audio files (about 5Mb) onto the server. Not a major problem, until we want to open access to the platform to other people...<br>
<br>
Editing was done using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> which works fine as long as you've got plenty of spare disk space. A 10Mb source mp3 (recorded on a Creative Nano mp3 player plugged into the mixing desk) becomes over 1Gb when imported into Audacity. The export from Audacity works fine though, and produces acceptable mp3 file sizes as long as you keep the bit rate at its lowest setting.<br>

<br>
So I moved everything over to <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>, which works well, but was incredibly slow at loading up and seemed to eat memory by the bucketload.<br>
<br>
But now, I've found the best of both worlds; an offline RSS reader that sychronizes with Bloglines. It's called "<a href="http://www.curiostudio.com/">GreatNews</a>". It's a tiny download, fires up immediately, and has all the features of RSS Bandit that I used, but more (for example, instead of fixed "flags" to put against items, I can create user-defined "labels" to pull things together into groups that I want to come back to. And an item can have more than one label. Ideal for bringing stuff together for a research project.<br>
<br>
So RSS Bandit has gone, and I can use Bloglines again.

<br>
As I put a few coherent thoughts together I'll post them here...<br>
<br>
At a recent workshop, we talked about "The Wisdom of Crowds", which describes the concept that "large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant—better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future."<br>
<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/">http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/</a><br>
<br>
Rather than thinking about professional development as something that comes out from a central learning organisation, the Wisdom of Crowds concept would treat the learning organisation as just one part of a network of people, organisations and resources (materials).<br>
<br>
In a well-connected network, each node (ie. a person, an organisation, or a resource), is initially no more important or indispensible than any other node. Any node can link to any other node. There is no hierarchy. However, nodes become more important as other nodes make links to them. They become hubs and thus key players in changing the way the network thinks. If a hub picks up an idea from one of its linked nodes, the idea will quickly disseminate through the rest of the network.<br>
<br>
To become a hub, you need to be seen to be offering something useful... perhaps that's where the consultants fit in... sifting ideas, sharing the best, developing new ideas. It is almost inevitable that the learning organisation will become a major hub since it will produce so much material. What then becomes important is how the other hubs make use of that material.<br>
<br>
But, for a network to operate well it needs to be open. If groups of nodes are kept separate from the rest, then the network is broken, and you lose the wisdom of crowds effect. That may have implications for the learning organisation, since an open network implies that a learner in Cornwall may "link" to an expert in Northumberland.<br>
<br>
Notice that I've not mentioned technology at all here. Networks can be built up without using technology, but they build quicker when you do use it (eg. with blogs, podcasts, RSS etc).</div><h1>Informal Learning: Geek Gatherings</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://natural-learning.blogspot.com/2005/08/geek-gatherings.html">http://natural-learning.blogspot.com/2005/08/geek-gatherings.html</a></p>From Jay Cross: <blockquote>Geeks are dedicated learners. They go to great lengths to stay ahead of the curve. Not content to merely implement the ideas of others, geeks are driven to invent the future. </blockquote><br>
<br>
That must make me a geek then... bother!</div><h1>The problem with Web2.0</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 November 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Don't get me wrong. Web2.0 concepts are great ... Small pieces loosely joined ... But the problem is that all these small pieces need their own username &amp; password combination.<br>
<br>
So, I've got a <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes </a>homepage that draws in a set of bookmarks from <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> that I've tagged specially to appear on the home page, along with a list of the documents I'm writing collaboratively on <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>, plus my most recent photos from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markberthelemy/">Flikr</a>, along with a weather forecast for Derby from <a href="http://uk.weather.com/index.html">The Weather Channel</a>. And I can use that home page on any internet-connected computer.<br>
<br>
But now that's several more usernames and passwords to remember... That's going to be a real barrier to most non-geeky (see previous post) people.</div><h1>Karyn's blog</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 November 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/">http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/</a></p>I work with Karyn.

The "brainstorms" gather a group of 5 practioners together, from across the world, and across the educational community (from primary school [US=elementary] to college to the workplace) sharing how they've used "EdTech" in their situations and what they're learning.<br>
<br>
As one of the presenters remarked recently, it's the easiest form of professional development, just listening to, and being inspired by these people.<br>

<br>
I just wonder how many large organisations, who are wedded to their learning management systems, and formal training programmes, will be ready for this approach to learning. The whole idea of distributed knowledge and networks is a difficult one to grasp. You don't end up with a <em>product</em>. Instead you get an ephemeral set of nodes and links that change and grow over time. Which to a "NewMil" person is totally natural, but to many managers is a long way from where they are.</div><h1>Things to consider when designing learning programmes</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 November 2005</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The following came from a group brainstorm at work and has since been severely pruned by me. We were looking at the process by which a learning programme to meet a specific learning need might be designed. Normally we tend to look immediately at the resources we need. However, until learning designers (and clients) understand the new, online world of learning as well as the old, offline world, we will always need to take them through a couple of stages beforehand:<br>
<br>
<em>Consider the context:</em><br>
Cultural: What is the CPD culture in your LA? What do people respond to well? What works and is effective?<br>
Infrastructure: What is in place that can be used to support CPD? eg. Network meetings, teacher centre, internet-based communication and collaboration tools. What access do the learners have to this infrastructure? What resources already exist?<br>
Management: Is school management supportive of CPD? How is CPD funded? How is time allocated?<br>
 <br>
What cultural, infrastructure and management constraints are you working within?<br>
 <br>
<em>Consider the activities your learners might do:</em><br>
When designing your learning programme it's important to take into account the theories that attempt to model how learning works: behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism, connectivism et al. The activities that your learners will do will be influenced strongly by the ways you believe people learn, and also by the context in which the learning is to take place (see above).<br>

<em>Consider the resources you may need to support those activities:</em><br>
The activities you choose will need resourcing, maybe with personnel, with an environment in which they are to take place, with media, or with design tools with which to create or aggregate new media. Your choice will be influenced by the context in which the learning is to take place, particularly the existing resources already available to you.<br>

Gilly Salmon (<a href="http://www.atimod.com/">http://www.atimod.com</a>) et al say that learning online only works in highly structured, time-constrained groups...<br>

Is that true for people who "live" online... those for whom being online and communicating online is as natural as working in the "real" world?

<br>
The biggest issue seems to be one of <em>time...</em><br>
<br>
Why, when we are trying to help our children reflect on their own learning (ie. the Assessment for Learning agenda), do we not build into our own professional learning time to reflect...? Blogging provides a brilliant mechanism for this - as it allows you to then connect with other like-minded people.</div><h1>Wikiville</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 February 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.wikiville.org.uk/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.wikiville.org.uk/index.php/Main_Page</a></p>Picked this up from <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2006/02/15#a4700">Will Richardson</a>.<br>

</div><h1>Staff development is no more?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>David Warlick - a commentator on teaching and learning in the US - has posted a thought-provoking piece entitled: "OK, no more staff development" in which he proposes we should be aiming for a school environment in which teachers:<br>
<br>
    * Have the time to reflect and retool (at least three hours a day),<br>
    * Have ready access to local and global ideas and resources that are logically and socially indexed,<br>
    * Have the skills to research, evaluate, collaborate, remix, and implement new tools and techniques (contemporary literacy),<br>
    * Are part of an ongoing professional conversation where the expressed purpose is to provoke change (adapt),<br>
    * Leave the school from time to time to have their heads turned by new experiences,<br>
    * Share what they and their students are doing with what they teach and learn %u2014 their information products and relics of learning become an explicit and irresistibly interwoven part of the school%u2019s culture.<br>
<br>
He goes on to say: "If we are trying to help our students to become life-long-learners, then this is what teachers should be right now."<br>
<br>
Then Jeff, a teacher in Shanghai, posts his reflections on his 25% CPD time, in which he says:<br>
<br>
This has been the best day of PD I could ever hope for. I was in control of my learning. I was able to click on links that were interesting and ignore the information that I felt didn%u2019t apply to me. I read, commented, reflected, bookmarked, and just felt the excitement inside me grow as I found some great stuff.<br>

I would agree with his issue about the permanence or otherwise of blog postings, as compared with published journals. It becomes the author's responsibility rather than the publisher's to keep the posting online.<br>
<br>

Most, if not all, of the information you need is on the <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a> community website, but this can appear a little confusing for new people.<br>
<br>
So here's a quick run-down of the first few things to do:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Take a look at the <a href="http://download.moodle.org/docs/presentations/presentation_en.ppt">Moodle powerpoint</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://moodle.org/sites/">http://moodle.org/sites/</a> to get a feel for who's running Moodle in your country.</li><br>
  <li>Have a play with the <a href="http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=34">Moodle Features Demo</a></li><br>
    <li>For a full demo of Moodle from an admin or a teacher's perspective, see <a href="http://demo.moodle.com/">http://demo.moodle.com</a>. This will let you play with the system in either of those roles.</li><br>
  <li>Install Moodle on your PC. If you haven't got Apache, PHP and MySQL already installed (not likely unless you're used to playing with these sorts of websites), then you can get an all-in-one Windows installer from: <a href="http://goohio.com/moodle/">http://goohio.com/moodle/</a></li><br>
 <li>Find a friendly ICT technician in your organisation, who can  download Moodle and install it on their web or intranet server. From start to finish (assuming the webserver is already setup with Apache, PHP and a database, eg. MySQL) the installation should take no more than 15 minutes.</li><br>
  <li>Buy some cheap webspace, but make sure they provide PHP &amp; MySQL with it. It's even better if they offer something like the Fantastico installation service. This will automatically install Moodle by clicking one button. Using cheap web-hosting will do as a starter, but will not cope well with more than 20 or so users, or even less if they're giving it a lot of usage.</li><br>
  <li>Pay for a <a href="http://moodle.com/hosting">Moodle partner</a> to host a Moodle site. You'll then know you've got an optimised server and someone who knows how to kick it if there's a problem (which is more likely to come from the server than from Moodle).</li><br>
<li>If your organisation is going to go for Moodle properly, it's a good idea to get some initial and ongoing support to help you configure the site and work out how it can best support the strategic direction of the organisation.<br>

<br>
In the comments <a href="http://jeroen-spierings.blogspot.com/">Jeroen Spierings</a> sets out two things that need to be focussed on:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>1) We need to focus on learning design instead of instructional design. Today much learning/training/education is still structured and organized top down. Instruction does not work in informal learning. Also focus on the environment and its context rather than on content. The learning content and resources are out there the question is how are we capable of designing an environment where we can connect the learner and the resources just in time. Focus on designing and supporting the environment. I agree with Jay's comments on informal learning content and formal learning support.<br>
<br>
2) We need to focus on learner engagement. How do we engage the learner and make sure that he/she is participating. How do we mobilize them which is not an issue related to just informal learning but also is related to formal training and education. Maybe we should focus on emotions in order to solve the above.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I agree with that, partially. I don't think we can remove the need for the central organisation to provide clearly written and structured information. But I do think that the critical thing for any organisation is to encourage a <em>culture</em> of learning that includes sharing and reflection, that is supported and modelled by management, where the organisation's commitment to development is not shown through a collection of training records, but through the learners' contributions to the shared knowledge &amp; practice of the organisation.</div><h1>Christopher Sessums on  Synthesizing Social Software: Working the Wide Web</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/13748.html">http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/13748.html</a></p><blockquote>The Internet provides me an opportunity, or more precisely, an ecology to connect, collaborate, and aggregate numerous ideas and contributions of others which permits me to further my understanding and share it with others.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I couldn't have said it better.<br>
<br>
Christopher's current set of writing on his blog is really striking a chord with me. He is focussing a lot on teacher professional development, and the place of reflective writing within it.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://theopenclassroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/blogging-means-of-reflection.html">Jo McLeay</a> has commented on it in relation to teachers in Victoria (Australia), who now have to prove that they've done some professional development before they can re-register after five years of teaching.<br>
<br>
One of the comments at the bottom of Jo's post was also very telling for me: <br>
<blockquote>When I was considering doing further study this year I decided against it and part of the reason was because I felt that blogging would be more challenging to me and I couldn't commit to both. <a href="http://www.bloxster.net/JohBlogs/"><em>Joh</em></a></blockquote><br>
<br>
I can relate to that totally. With blogging you are able to explore and reflect on the matters of the moment, on the things that you are learning through the learning ecology you've built around you. With formal learning programmes, you're forced down certain avenues, not of your own making, and outside of your control; often irrelevant to what you really need to learn. Unless, that is, the tutors working with you can adapt to meet your learning needs (not <i>styles</i>...) I suppose that's what the whole personalised learning agenda is all about.</div><h1>Mark Berthelemy :: Weblog :: My hidden agenda: Developing reflective practice</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://elgg.cpdconnections.net/berthelemy/weblog/109.html">http://elgg.cpdconnections.net/berthelemy/weblog/109.html</a></p>If anyone's interested in my not-so hidden agenda, I've posted some thoughts on my CPD Connections blog. They're reproduced here for my own reference, but if you want to comment, you'll need to go to the original post.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><h3> My hidden agenda: Developing reflective practice</h3><br>
		<br>
			Well, not so hidden, as it's my main topic of conversation for anyone that will listen!<br><br>
<br>
Reflective practice is an essential part of any effective professional development. And that goes for any role in any organisation, whether you're a doctor, a teacher, a manager, or a packer on the factory floor. If we don't reflect on what we're doing, and try to find ways to improve it, we simply become cogs in a machine, rather than key parts in the machine's development.<br><br>
<br>
Now, I know a lot depends on the motivation of the individuals and the ways in which the organisation allows learning to happen. But my aim is to encourage that sort of bottom-up and top-down learning which hopefully meets in the middle.<br><br>
<br>
I'm in good company: Christpher Sessums (<a href="http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/">[Click to view link]</a>) is a keen advocate of reflective practice as part of teacher professional development, as is Jo McLeay (<a href="http://theopenclassroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/teacher-reflecting.html">[Click to view link]</a>). Jo make's the point that "No matter what method of reflection you use, mental, verbal, or written, it is a vital tool to use towards self-improvement in teaching." I would remove the last two words here... reflection is a vital tool to use towards self-improvement. In whatever context.<br><br>
<br>
So, how do we encourage the bottom-up motivation, and the top-down enabling? What needs to happen so that people will reflect on what they're learning? Where does shared reflection fit in (like we're doing here at CPD Connections)? How should an organisation guide reflection on a specific focus area?<br><br>
<br>
<br>
My view is that every level of the organisation needs to be doing reflective practice, and if senior levels wish to encourage shared reflection, they themselves need to be modelling it. Now, for many organisations, that's a massive culture shift - towards a far more open way of working, where the ideas of any individual hold equal weight.<br>
<br><br>
Is this me being idealistic? I don't think so. Modern organisations are finding that in order to be able to change direction rapidly, they need a much more flexible and open networked structure, which encourages learning and development and thus creativity. John Seely-Brown &amp; John Hagel's draft paper "From push to pull: Emerging Models for Mobilizing Resources", describes a number of case studies particularly well: <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/pushmepullyou4.72.pdf">[Click to view link]</a><br><br>
<br>
John Seely-Brown also provides a number of useful resources around creating a culture of learning: <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/speeches.html#learningculture">[Click to view link]</a> The video clip is a particularly good introduction to the changes that might be required.			<br>
</blockquote></div><h1>Why do we do research?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Why do we do research at all? It's to get a best-fit picture of the world and how things work, so that we can persuade other people to take advantage of new ways of working, that have been shown to work for other people.<br>
<br>
What research doesn't show is that these new ways will definitely work for everyone. But that's the way it's often used. Take the Plowden report for example (See: <a href="http://www.infed.org/schooling/plowden_report.htm">http://www.infed.org/schooling/plowden_report.htm</a> ). It offered a well-researched approach to schooling, showing where that approach had worked. Yet, there are many examples of schools that tried the approach piecemeal, without the full understanding of what was involved, and it failed. I think the Rose report on children's reading is going to be very similar. I also think the same will be for new approaches to learning that use ICT. There will be the places that have a good understanding of what it means, and its implications, where positive results (whatever that might mean!) are attained. But those new approaches will still fail in many places that don't have that full understanding.<br>
<br>
So, I think I'm saying we still need rigorous research, but it's alright to be done on a small scale, as long as those small-scale results are not used to make large-scale policy changes. Instead used to support more small-scale, organic changes via a community of practice.<br>
<br>
This is where I've been struggling I think. Sociological research has, in my mind, been a poor relation to scientific research, where, using the same methodology you should be able to replicate the results, which can then be analysed numerically and graphically. I've not been able to see how you can even attempt to do that when you're dealing with people. I'm still not sure, but at least I know now what questions I need to ask.</div><h1>extendingtheschool.pdf (application/pdf Object)</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://stiveshaslemere.com/mgb/extendingtheschool.pdf">http://stiveshaslemere.com/mgb/extendingtheschool.pdf</a></p>Presentation from Miles Berry about Learning Platforms (and other technologies) in schools.<br>

The key thing brought out in it is the need for people to understand the business model that sits behind the free stuff. If the business model is not sustainable (everyone needs to eat somehow), then neither is the product. However, there are many products, some of which are referenced in the article, which <em>do</em> have a demonstrably sustainable business model, so why shouldn't other businesses make use of them?</div><h1>LearningNetworks</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/media/LearningNetworks/player.html">http://www.elearnspace.org/media/LearningNetworks/player.html</a></p>As always, George Siemens has provided a stimulating and thought-provoking presentation.<br>
<br>
Questions for me:<br>
<br>
How do we interpret this thinking about learning networks inside organisations where learning is seen as formal (hierarchical?) programmes? How can we explain the concepts of learning networks and informal learning in terms that will be understood throughout the organisation?<br>
<br>

<br>
His focus is on workplace learning, and he emphasises (correctly, I believe) the need to embed and support informal learning.<br>

This is a good 16 minute presentation for those wanting to get a quick understanding of where things are going.

In my mind, the critical part of the process was setting up a "Straw man" in the wiki, for others to tear apart. Building from scratch is often much harder.</div><h1>The Wales-Wide Web | Pedagogy, social software, ubiquitous computing and e-learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/entries/7594242429">http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/entries/7594242429</a></p>Graham Atwell in a well-researched paper on new models for training and vocational learning.<br>
<br>
<blockquote> To utilise the opportunities for new forms of didactics will require profound reform in education and training systems and practice and new responsibilities and roles for teachers and trainers.<br>
<br>
Two requirements stand out. The first is the need for wider and more flexible occupational profiles capable of being shaped both by the learners and by the requirements of changing technologies and work processes. It is striking that through informal learning in SMEs learners were able to develop new and emergent occupational practice, building on previous learning and shaping the use of new technologies in the work process.<br>
<br>
The second involves the structure and form of the curriculum. Present formal e-learning is largely context free, is usually subject based, and is sequenced by teachers and trainers. Above all e-learning is driven by the demands of the education process, rather than by the demands of the work process. A new didactical approach requires curricula based on a holistic understanding of work processes, allowing learners to create and make as they learn and to engage in a community of practice through their activities and understanding of those activities. In this way the subject of learning and the process of learning can be brought together developing new and dynamic forms of ‘applied knowledge’ or ‘work process knowledge’ as both the subject and object of learning. </blockquote><br>
<br>
The question for me always come back to motivation. Why should people learn what the organisation thinks they ought to learn?</div><h1>Jackie Danicki » VNU Blogs &amp; Social Media Forum notes</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.jackiedanicki.com/?p=480">http://www.jackiedanicki.com/?p=480</a></p>Jackie captures the gist of what happened at last week's blogs and social media conference.

A revolution that will mean learners and teachers working in a new relationship, with a new, more appropriate curriculum; developing skills that will help them become better learners, who are more able to deal with the rapidly changing world (and job market) around them, and using communications technologies to expand horizons beyond the classroom wall.<br>
<br>
Some places have taken this at a high level and run with it (eg. <a href="http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/parents/teaching/els">Tasmania's Essential Learning Framework</a>), but most countries, local authorities, school districts, corporate learning &amp; development departments etc seem reluctant to embrace the inevitable disruption and political backlash that would happen.<br>
<br>
And it is disruptive... The traditional, top-down view of learning, where a person is given a teaching "position", ...<br>
<img src="./assets/teachers.jpg" border="0" alt="Top-down teaching model"><br>
<br>
... is changed, through the effective use of communications technology, to an apprenticeship model, where the mature learner chooses the teacher:<br>
<br>
<img src="./assets/learners.jpg" border="0" alt="Networked learners"><br>
<br>
There is a total shift in the balance of power. But it depends totally on learners being mature enough to take advantage of it, and teachers being mature enough to accept that their position is fixed only while they are useful to the learners.<br>
<br>
For people involved in leading &amp; administering learning it is very easy to drop back into the comfort zone of programmes, courses, tests etc - what some people call the <a href="http://www.jarche.com/node/677">"industrial model"</a> of learning. Yet that model just will not survive in the current, rapidly changing world, where knowledge is out-of-date faster than you can forget it.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Learning can no longer be seen as an activity separate from other information and knowledge-based activities. Learning, knowledge management, content management, information management, and other knowledge capital systems must function coherently as a whole. <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/google_whitepaper.pdf">George Siemens: Google Whitepaper (pdf)</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
What is needed, at all levels of education and learning, is an emphasis on developing:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>mature learners, who know how to learn, how to manage information, who to ask, how to find out, and what questions to ask.</li><br>
  <li>mature teachers, who know how to learn, but also know how to coach and mentor.</li><br>
  <li>systems and environments that can be used to support <em>learners</em> in their learning process. It's not about creating "programmes", it's about creating "environments" within which a "learning ecology" can flourish.</li><br>
</ul><br>

<br>
How this is worked out will depend on the situation people are working in, but the critical thing, whenever you are talking about learning ecologies, is they are based around networks of individuals, and their connections. Starting with that premise will give a good foundation on which to build.</div><h1>Learning Networks</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 31 May 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=34470">http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=34470</a></p>Stephen Downes captures perfectly what it means to base our learning ecologies on networks. (Powerpoint slides + mp3 audio)<br>
<br>
Critical points for me:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>... theories of online distance learning must:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>capture the expression of self as a network of connections</li><br>
  <li>place this self at the centre of the learning experience</li><br>

</blockquote><br>
<br>
and, in comparing "traditional" with "networked" delivery models:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong>Traditional Online Learning</strong><br>
<br>

I'll take as read the <a href="http://anglicansonline.org/basics/apostles.html">Apostle's Creed</a>, (which I'm happy to debate, but unlikely to change), but what about what I believe in terms of learning and education? Where do I stand at the moment? On what am I basing the decisions I make about teaching &amp; learning.

<br>
I've started trying to work this out on a wikispace. It's not the sort of thing I can do entirely on my own. There needs to be debate and refining if we're to end up with a coherent set of principles &amp; beliefs, that can act as the foundations for our actions.

It doesn't need to be an essay. Just a set of well-written, succinct, statements - setting out a position.<br>

Yet in her first post she goes to the heart of what blogging means to a lot of people:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>As I sit to write some thoughts on this blog, I automatically have the thought that what I write will be no good, or boring or insignificant, or of little use to anyone.  'Whose going to read it anyway' immediately comes up as a barrier to even starting, closely followed by 'what is the purpose of the blog?' Is it to engage new clients, to inspire and motivate? to touch someones heart who might be browsing on the web?<br>
<br>
Do you know what I'm not sure what its purpose is-I am writing into the unknown, with no attachment or expectation of what might come back, or what interest it might generate.<br>
<br>
I do notice though that when I write I feel very content, very focused and I suppose I get into that zone that athletes might call flow. It's something I love to do, it helps me clarify my thoughts, my state, my mood, it helps me to be more aware of what I am doing, and why I am doing it. Even if I don't know the answers to my own questions the process moves me a little nearer to that point of clarity and with clarity comes the motivation to act, to move forward towards a goal, sure of it's intention and fully assured of its inspiration.<br>
<br>
So I write this first entry on this blog unsure of my goal in having a blog-perhaps its not a marketing tool, a communication tool, perhaps its not so that I can reach you but so that I can really reach me!</blockquote><br>

Stanford Business School recently hosted him and the presentation was recorded by the <a href="http://www.siconversations.org/index.html">Social Innovations Conversations</a> (which often has some excellent, thought-provoking content).<br>
<br>
Al Gore didn't disappoint. Even without the visuals for which his talk is renowned his ideas came across clearly and persuasively. His closing section on looking back at Earth from the Voyager spaceprobe in order to see things in perspective was particularly powerful - although, depending on your worldview, it could either lead you to do great things or send you into the depths of depression!<br>
<br>
Listening to this, and reading <a href="http://www.tearfund.org/">TearFund's</a> recent magazine brings me back to a question I keep asking myself: "How can IT, the internet, computers, learning technology, my skills &amp; experience really help towards solving some of these big issues of climate change, TB, AIDS, etc, etc? Am I just wasting time on stuff because it's interesting &amp; because it pays the bills, or is there a way in which that stuff can be channelled for the greater good, not just for those people who can afford the technology?"<br>
<br>
I've been asking that since I started teaching ICT 20 years ago, and still haven't come to a definite conclusion. It's a matter of trying to link the "Why am I here?" question with the "What am I doing about it?" question....</div><h1>Curverider Conference Review</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 September 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was really pleased I managed to get to Edinburgh for yesterday's <a href="http://curverider.co.uk/conferences.php">Curverider Conference</a>. As others mentioned during the day, it was like a meeting of people who've known each other for a while. Even though I had never met any of them before, there were so many people there who's blogs I read regularly, I felt I knew them already.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick run down of the day - with some of my key learning points highlighted. I had to leave before <a href="http://elgg.net/bwerdmuller">Ben Werdmuller's</a> keynote at the end, so I'm looking forward to picking that up when it goes live on Google video.<br>
<br>
We started with a presentation from <a href="http://terrya.edublogs.org/">Terry Anderson</a> on Institutional Adoption Issues with Social Software. I've been following Terry's work for a while; his open-source book on <a href="http://cde.athabascau.ca/online_book/">"The Theory &amp; Practice of Online Learning"</a> has been a major influence.<br>
<br>
Athabasca University has a totally different model to most if not all educational organisations, in that they operate continuous enrolment - you can join a course at any time. This has great advantages (in that you learn when you need to learn, not when the organisation says you can learn), but great disadvantages, particularly around building groups of collaborative learners. Terry sees social software (and specifically <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a>) playing a part in solving this problem. Even so, there are always barriers to adoption in the mainstream part of the organisation. He led us through some of the models &amp; theories around innovation - which need a lot more thinking about than I've done so far.<br>
<br>
One thing that Terry said, and formed the basis for quite a bit of informal discussion later, was about the demise of the VLE/LMS - at a point when a lot of companies &amp; schools are only just starting to work out what a VLE is good for. I think he's right, but I also think that moving straight to a social networking environment for supporting learning might be a step too far for many organisations - given the complete paradigm shift and reassignment of control that it entails. [And anyway, I've got too much tied up in <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> to give up with it that easily. :-) ]<br>

<a href="http://elgg.net/misja/">Misja Hoebe</a> presented his experiences at CHN University in the Netherlands. CHN is a global university, with a common curriculum, with many students travelling between campuses for different parts of their programmes. They are re-emphasising their philosophy which puts Problem Based Learning as the main means of developing learners. With this approach, the student is in the centre of everything, and any system that is used to support learning needs to take this into account. It sounded like Misja is on a quest to find a small toolkit of preferred applications - one of which is most probably going to be Elgg, which is based totally around the individual.<br>
<br>

Elgg can integrate with LDAP - which is critical if you need to get a lot of people, within an organisation, into the system very quickly, which is necessary to gain the critical mass required to sustain the <br>
"community". Not so helpful in our CPD Connections context, which isn't tied to any particular organisation.<br>

<a href="http://elgg.net/stans/">Stan Stanier</a> from Brighton University was next up. Brighton will be the largest implementation of Elgg, with over 30000 users. They are integrating it into StudentCentral, which is their portal for students (mainly based on Blackboard) and has the strapline "Cool, funky &amp; georgeous", which sort of shows the attitude that the university is taking towards it. They're trying to make it as attractive and fun as possible, not necessarily functional like many organisation's VLEs.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><em>Learning Points:</em><br>
<br>
Clear branding is essential to build a sense of community. Even if people don't like the branding it needs to be there. A design that polarises people is better than one that is bland and unappealing.<br>
<br>
The required critical mass for social networking is dependent on the culture of the group. If people don't want to post stuff online they won't. It's about people not technology. As Elliot Maisie highlighted a few years ago, success in elearning is 1/3 support, 1/3 motivation &amp; 1/3 marketing.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<a href="http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog">Chris Sessums</a> (from Floriday University) is another person who's blog posts teach me so much. He is involved in Teacher Training, and has a huge amount of insight into the ways in which social networking software can support teacher professional development. To be honest, I can't remember what his talk was about - I'm going to have to pick it up when it gets published. But even so I did learn a lot!<br>
<br>
<blockquote><em>Learning Points:</em><br>
<br>
As an example to use of a teacher using reflective writing to improve her practice, Barbara Ganley is probably one of the best. <br>

<a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/">http://www.banksy.co.uk/</a><br>
<br>
Most action research takes place in a vacuum, with teachers going through a cycle of: experiment, reflect, learn, experiment etc. What social networking does is allows the teacher to pick up ideas easily from other teachers who are trying similar experiments, or in similar situations. In a similar way to Stephen Downes' concept of teaching resources never being finished, instead they are improvements on the previous person's ideas, the same happens with teaching ideas.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.storiesabout.com/bio.php">Chris McKillop</a> gave a presentation in which she highlighted the need for structure in reflection - giving people a scaffold, based on a story-telling idea - within which they could begin to reflect on practice. These prompts are along the lines of:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Tell me a similar story to this one...</li><br>
  <li>What is your viewpoint on this story...</li><br>
  <li>I wonder what would happen if ...</li><br>
  <li>What have you learnt?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Next up, after an extended lunch break (thanks Ewan!), was <a href="http://elgg.net/mberry">Miles Berry</a>. I'd spent a lot of time during the breaks with Miles and <a href="http://elgg.leeds.ac.uk/soc6tjw/weblog/">Terry Wassall</a> and knew that we have a lot in common in the way we think about education , but I hadn't realised quite how similarly we think... You see Miles puts things in terms of journeys, landscapes &amp; maps, which, for me, is a fantastic metaphor to use. It's a way of describing how learning happens in peoples' heads; that you build up a mental picture of how things fit together, just as you build up a picture of a new town (just as I did first thing in the morning when I wandered through and explored Edinburgh).<br>
<br>
<blockquote><em>Learning Points:</em><br>
<br>
Moodle (or similar systems) are useful to help take school to home.<br>
Elgg (being based around the individual) is useful in taking home into school.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
After Miles, we raced through a couple of presentations from <a href="http://elgg.net/bfitzgerald/">Bill Fitzgerald</a> &amp; <a href="http://elgg.net/radagast/">Kevin Jardine</a>.<br>
<br>
Bill was talking about building class web sites using Drupal. In a similar way to Misja he is focussing on the learners at the centre, and with the teacher as a co-learner. The beauty of doing it within Drupal instead of Elgg is that Drupal allows you to have fixed vocabularies as well as free tagging and then to extract particular groups or types of items based on the vocabulary used. I just wish that the admin side of Drupal was slightly easier to use. That's the problem with such a flexible system; unless you know exactly what you want to do with it, just playing often leaves you frustrated.<br>
<br>
Kevin demonstrated a couple of exciting developments: OpenID and SSE feeds. OpenID means that you can set one application to authenticate users and then other applications just feed off of that single point of authentication and also get user profile information. It wasn't quite single sign-on, as you still needed to put in your OpenID username, but it's getting there. SSE feeds are similar to RSS, but they also contain information about updates to the data, and so can be used to feed search engines. Thus allowing one search engine to search multiple sites. The possibilities are endless... as demonstrated by the interest shown from the delegates at the conference.<br>
<br>
To wrap up, thanks to Dave, Ben &amp; Misja for organising a really good day. It was great to be able to put voices to the names &amp; the pictures.<br>
<br>
I've just got to sort out two things now - using what I've learnt:<br>

  <li>How to pull these ideas together into a cohorent plan for my dissertation on social networking and CPD</li><br>

<br>
As this is likely to be the subject of my dissertation, I am hoping to develop the series by including interviews, questionnaire results &amp; surveys which will form the basis of my research into social networking and CPD.<br>

At some point, when I upgrade the Elgg software, I'll be able to post things here and have them duplicated into CPD Connections, but for the moment they are two separate systems.</div><h1>Confused Of Calcutta ï¿½ Blog Archive ï¿½ Musing about mail</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 September 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/08/31/musing-about-mail/">http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/08/31/musing-about-mail/</a></p>Does email increase productivity in teams or does it actually decrease productivity?

The VLE in question automatically shows who has read which messages; so that I could post a message in a forum, for example, and see who has read it.<br>
<br>
Which leads to the question, just because we can, does it mean we should? I mean, just because we can now track who's opened which pages in a particular learning resource, and who's read which messages what does that actually tell you? That they've opened a particular piece of data in a database - not that they've done anything with it.<br>
<br>
The reason given for this functionality is that it's a data protection issue - the writer must know who has read their messages. But it could be argued that this is invading the reader's privacy (I nearly always ignore a request for read receipts on emails). And anyway, isn't it a bit like bolting the stable door after the horse has gone? It's too late - your post is no longer private if the wrong person has read it.<br>
<br>
I have two assumptions when I put <em>anything</em> in writing, particularly online:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>I can't guarantee that once it's been sent, posted, mailed etc that only the person for whom it was intended might read it.</li><br>
  <li>I can only guarantee that someone has   read what I've written by the response they give me.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, what are the implications of those assumptions?<br>

  <li>Be very careful what you write online</li><br>

<br>
Personally, I'm not a fan of most of the stuff that I see out there purporting to be elearning. I've got a very short attention span, and most of it just does not engage me, and usually puts too many barriers in the way before I even get started.<br>
<br>
But this, from the BBC, has grabbed me totally. No learning objectives. Not even any indication it's about Rome (except for the URL). But, now I'm getting the idea of what it's about, and I just want more!<br>
<br>
It's a narrative. It's an adventure game. It's got suspense. But it's also got the "normal" learning things, such as questions and information sources. But in this case the questions have a purpose - I can't go further in the narrative without finding out the answers. The information sources aren't necessarily inside the narrative (eg. they seem to have set up a TypePad blog specifically to support it), and they're not just the standard text/graphics resource. The radio in particular was a stroke of genius - how better to set a time/location context than a radio that you could tune yourself?<br>
<br>
Got to stop writing now, and get back to the game, sorry, learning.<br>
<br>
[Edit] Fascinating this. I've just shown the BBC Rome game to my wife, and she couldn't see the point... if she wants information about Rome she'd just look it up on Google, why does she need to "faff around" with a game? Hmmm... does this sort of thing depend on either a) innate curiousity and fascination with new things or b) a teacher figure who is saying you need to learn such and such, and here's a fun way to do it?</div><h1>Response to Steven Downes: Learning Networks and Connective Knowledge</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 October 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://it.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper92/paper92.html">http://it.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper92/paper92.html</a></p><p>There is a lot in Stephen's recent paper that I don't yet understand. At some point it will be interesting to explore the links he provides to delve into the various philosophies and theories that can be used to understand learning. But, for the moment, I'm going to focus on some of the implications that arise from his reasoning and try to work out how his theories fit into the realities that we work within.</p><br>
<p>There has been a lot of thinking recently about "learning networks". I have followed Stephen's thinking on it over the past couple of years, along with the work done by George Siemens. This fed into my paper this year on <a href="http://elgg.cpdconnections.net/berthelemy/files/-1/13/social_networking_and_NS_v1_2.pdf">Social Networks &amp; Teacher Professional Development</a> where I tried to analyse, based on theories of developing social capital, how social networking tools can support teacher CPD.</p><br>
<p>Using network ideas to support learning seems to be an ideal way forward; it fits my understanding of how learning actually happens, and fits what I see happening in the real world around informal learning - people learning through the connections they make with resources and other people.</p><br>
<h3>Networks are about people</h3><br>
<p>What I find hard to do is to square the current state of "formal" learning with network ideas. By formal, I mean where there is a curriculum or an agenda set by a person other than the learner. For example at school, in college, or in the workplace.</p><br>
<p>Networks consist of individual nodes, each of which can make connections with other nodes. In a computer network the connections are made by virtue of software seeking out other nodes, or through hardware that has been used to join the node to the network. When we talk about networks of people we need to remember that every individual has a choice as to whether they connect and who they connect to. When the connections are made information can flow; conversations can happen. But there must be a level of motivation to make each connection - the individual will need to have some sort of knowledge of "what's in it for them". The level of intrinsic motivation (and confidence), required to contribute to a network, is vast. How is that change in culture going to going to happen?</p><br>
<p>When an organisation is setting the learning goals for a group of individuals (or nodes in the network), how do they persuade those individuals to make the appropriate connections? How do they encourage them to begin to allow the flow of information to happen? I suppose it's the role of the teacher/mentor/facilitator to devise appropriate activities that will engage and support connection making. Terry Anderson and Donna Cameron's work on developing <a href="http://docs.google.com/View.aspx?docid=ag9j97p7pg73_ahh5gqp63qx4">"collaborative learning activities using social software tools"</a> is very useful in this scenario. It's similar, in a way, to the face-to-face facilitator who is trying to encourage a group of people to collaborate/network in a training room. The difference being at least you've got people motivated enough to come to the training room in the first place!</p><br>
<p>The mentor/facilitator role is going to be critical in this new world; playing, as Stephen describes, the role of "aggregator, assimilator, analyst and advisor". In the workplace this is perhaps the role of the manager (but in the knowledge that that role may be usurped at any time by any other person on the network)? The question then is how do organisations standardise on policies, procedures and practice that are essential for the organisation to run effectively? And how do those standards get "pushed out" to the people who will apply them - which is the focus for a lot of workplace learning at the moment?</p><br>
<h3>Research &amp; Evaluation</h3><br>
<p>Stephen's paper ends with a description of how we might research the effectiveness of learning in a networked environment. The current causal models of evaluation - where researchers try to establish links between variables - are just not possible when dealing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Link to Wikipedia entry on chaos theory">chaotic, non-linear systems</a>. Instead we need to bring in the research methods used by fields such as meteorology - modelling, simulation, pattern recognition etc.</p><br>
<p>But, at least with meteorology and other non-linear sciences, there is a behaviour or output that can be measured, such as the height of a wave, or the strength of a storm. What is the equivalent when we talk about human behaviour? Perhaps we need to be using "intelligence" techniques that analyse thousands of conversations, looking for patterns. So, rather than saying "we need to measure x", instead, as Stephen describes, we need to look at everything, conversations, links, activity etc and see what patterns emerge.</p><br>
<p>Will these patterns emerge only in large networks, eg. the network of bloggers? In which case, how do you "measure" the effectiveness of a particular intervention in a small organisation? Or with an individual? And if networks are inherently self-selecting, are we actually measuring how effective we have been at marketing the network?</p><br>
<p>Lots of questions, no answers yet - but I'm starting to see where my dissertation might be heading...</p><br>

Pretty much everything I can do in a VLE (except for multi-choice assessment tools) is now possible with a Google account.<br>
<br>
So, technically I now don't need to buy into a VLE. But the decision needs to be based on wider issues than that. The main one being trust... can I trust my service provider to maintain the level of service I need, with the level of privacy and security I require?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how Google will do in this market. They're obviously looking for more users on which they can base their highly successful targetted advertising, but how they do that whilst still maintaining the trust of school administrators and teachers remains to be seen.</div><h1>Managing Organisational Change</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 1 November 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://moodle.ulcc.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=794">http://moodle.ulcc.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=794</a></p>Philip Butler, Senior Curriculum Adviser for the JISC Regional Support Centre for London has produced a fascinating presentation about implementing VLEs.

<br>
Apart from some key thoughts that break down some of business's sacred cows about the need for data prior to decision making, and about the need to focus on the core business, he also fixes his eye again on education:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Education (and let's throw in training while we are at it) is bankrupt - we don't need to fix it; we need to start from scratch and re-think it, starting with the terminology. It represents a huge drain on resources at best and, at worst, takes bright and inquiring minds and slowly but inevitably extinguishes passion for learning... We need to learn ... to develop new institutional learning architectures recognizing that learning is a life-long requirement and that push approaches play an increasingly marginal role in successful<br>
learning.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I agree. Pull is very much about the individual taking responsibility for their own learning - which means the individual needs to know what they need to learn. That is a major change of attitude, culture and preconceptions.<br>
<br>
So, where do we start?<br>

His superb <a href="http://www.jaycross.com/informal_book/poster.htm">poster on Informal Learning</a> should, I believe, be on the wall of everyone responsible for procuring, designing &amp; delivering learning opportunities. </div><h1>We want to buy a learning module...</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 November 2006</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>How often do I hear that? Whether it's in invitations to tender, or meetings with clients, the key thing is always the "product" - the learning materials, the book, the website, the discussion forum, etc, etc...<br>
<br>
When given the chance, I always try to respond with some questions:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Who is going to use this "product"?</li><br>
  <li>Why are they going to use it?</li><br>
  <li>What is going to motivate them to use it?</li><br>
  <li>What will a set of web pages offer over and above a document that people could print out to read at their leisure?</li><br>
  <li>If it's going to be assessed, then who will see the assessment? What will users be able to do (or not do) dependant on the results of the assessment?</li><br>
  <li>If it's down to the managers to make people use it, then how will the managers a) know about it, and b) be encouraged to promote it?</li><br>
  <li>How will users find out about the "product"?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
There's one word that describes this - <b>marketing</b>. And it's the one, absolutely essential thing that most people leave out when they are designing learning programmes or resources.<br>
<br>
Here's a scenario:<br>
<br>
Imagine I've been asked to write a book. It's going to have fantastic content, brilliantly laid out, and very engaging! I write it, the publishers approve it and it goes out to all the bookshops in the country. Yet all the metrics (ie. royalties coming in) indicate that take up has been pitiful. I go into a couple of the bookshops to try to find out why. The assistants are very helpful - they find my book on their systems and point me to it, sitting at the back of the shop, along with hundreds of other books on the same subject. I watch, and maybe a couple of students of the subject wander into that section during the day. One of them even takes down the book to have a quick look... But no-one buys.<br>
<br>
Let's try the alternative:<br>
<br>
I write the same book. It gets approved, but the publisher has also put in place a marketing plan, that looked something like this:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Launch day - 4 months: The cover of the book and the blurb is designed, based on the initial draft of the book;</li><br>
<li>Launch day - 3 months: Bookshop staff are introduced to the new book via the publisher's newsletter;</li><br>
<li>Launch day - 2 months: Posters and point of sale marketing collateral materials are commissioned;</li><br>
<li>Launch day - 1 month: Key contacts, such as bookshop staff, trusted reviewers and recommenders (eg. managers) are sent preview copies of the book;</li><br>
<li>Launch day - 1 week: Marketing collateral arrives in the bookshops, reviewers and authors are invited to talk about the book on the media channels used by potential readers;</li><br>
<li>Launch day: The book arrives in the bookshops. The target audience is aware of the book. Their managers are aware of the book - and why their staff should read it.</li><br>
<li>Launch day + 1 week: The book has lived up to expectations and is attracting a wider audience.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Of these, only the last point is in the control of the author - the rest has been addressed by the publisher. But how many organisations procuring learning materials put this amount of effort into ensuring they are going to be used? How much money is wasted simply because people are a) not aware of the materials or b) not engaged enough to seek them out?<br>
<br>
Elliot Masie wrote about this in a 1999 <a href="http://trends.masie.com/archives/1999/06/129_special_rep.html">Special Report from a CBT Conference</a>: "Marketing must be an integral and continuous core component of implementation!" <br>
<br>
Yet, we're still in the situation where, usually, by the time the materials suppliers are brought in, it's already too late to put much marketing effort together...<br>

<br>
Anyway, I was trying to explain the benefits of being plugged-in to the worldwide network of edubloggers, as opposed to restricting communications within the university's VLE.<br>
<br>
One the reasons I gave was that I learn just by listening-in to the conversations that are going on amongst people in the edublogosphere. It's not usually written in the academic language that University people seem to like - but it's the closest I'm coming to real-life action research - with people writing about what they've tried and how it went.<br>

For me, my circle of the wise started out with <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> (who came well recommended from <a href="http://www.hull.ac.uk/ces/courses/DebraMarsh.html">Debra Marsh</a>). From there, the circle of the wise has extended to many people who are my key thinkers in the fields of learning technology, elearning &amp; knowledge management. Almost all have come via recommendations from other people to whom I am already linked.<br>
<br>
It's like being able to walk in a crowded conference room amongst many enlightening and thought-provoking conversations, to listen in, and to be encouraged to contribute where I wish. What a privilege!<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why so few people in academia don't appear to take advantage of this? Am I missing something?<br>

<br>
Thanks to <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2007/01/coffield-strikes-again.html">Donald Clark</a> I've just read <a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/schools/leid/lss/FCInauguralLectureDec06.doc">Prof. Coffield's inaugural lecture</a> (Word doc) for the Institute for Education in London. It's called: "Running Ever Faster Down the Wrong Road: An Alternative Future for Education and Skills". In it he eloquently describes the situation the learning &amp; skills sector (post-compulsory education) is in, and offers well-researched suggestions for a "fundamental redesign" that will not necessarily "rock the boat", but will stop it "hitting the iceberg" it is currently heading towards at full speed.<br>
<br>
He concludes:<br>
<blockquote>Can this disorganised, troubled but pivotal sector still be turned into a learning system?  That would require politicians and policy makers to change some of their fundamental beliefs and practices and to think and talk differently; institutions to reorder their priorities in favour of pedagogy; and professionals to be given the space and resources to improve their existing expertise.  The chances are very slim, but it could be done.</blockquote><br>
<br>
He makes the point at the beginning of the lecture that the learning &amp; skills sector is not unique in this situation, and there are parallels in every sector of education (and other public services):<br>
<br>
<blockquote>The same fault lines or, to change the metaphor, the same malaises, run through the reform agenda of government whether they affect the primary, secondary, higher education or post-compulsory sector (or the health service or the probation service, for that matter).</blockquote><br>
<br>
Prof. Coffield has also recently criticised the DfES booklet on Learning Styles, calling for its withdrawal, saying "The booklet is woefully uninformed about research. It is also impractical, patronising, uncritical and potentially dangerous to students." (Source: <a href="http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=1397&amp;1397_1=12998">IoE press release</a>)<br>
<br>
I couldn't agree more. The whole concept of learning styles is fragmented into dozens of different models that to use just one model, and to apply it in every case to every student at every time is going to cause far more problems than it solves.<br>
<br>
For me, its important to recognise that different people learn best in different ways at different times in different contexts and with different subject matter. And that's where I would want to leave it. The use of learning styles questionnaires is too blunt an instrument to be at all useful.<br>
<br>
NB. It looks like the booklet <em>has</em> been withdrawn. But a search will still turn it up on various school and local authority websites.</div><h1>Blog of proximal development : I Will Be a Gardener</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.teachandlearn.ca/blog/2007/01/03/i-will-be-a-gardener/">http://www.teachandlearn.ca/blog/2007/01/03/i-will-be-a-gardener/</a></p>Konrad Glogowski describes how his classroom blogging community has developed over the past year, and how he has realised the need to cultivate that community.<br>

The session outline is:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Online social networking tools have the potential to support reflective and collaborative CPD both within and across schools and local authorities. This session will examine whatâ€™s possible, raise a number of issues, and suggest ways in which using such tools can become an integrated part of your CPD approach.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I'm totally convinced that, to get the best out of a conference you a) need to know where people are coming from beforehand, and b) have some means of follow-up. Keeping in mind that social networks really only work when the conversation is two way, I intend to use this blog to pose a number of "sparks" before the session. This is so that a) I can find out who, in my network, will be there, and b) collect some more examples of where online networks have supported CPD.<br>
<br>
I am hoping that the conversation will continue into the session in Torquay. Although I need to think how that will work with an audience of 150+ ?<br>
<br>
Being part of a network is all about what you do as an individual. It's not really about organisations or the other people in the network. So the session will conclude with some very practical ideas to help people develop their own personal CPD network, and how to encourage that development in with teachers they work with.<br>
<br>
So, with all that in mind, what questions and issues would you want to see addressed in this session? I know that many people who read this blog won't be at the session itself, but that's the beauty of online networks - there are no physical or temporal barriers to participation.</div><h1>New site - new name - new feed</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you have come to this blog via <a href="http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs">www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs</a> please amend your bookmarks and your RSS subscription to point to its new home, which is <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/">www.learningconversations.co.uk</a>.<br>

<p>We've called it Working in a Blended Learning Environment (WinBLE). It partly involves understanding and applying <a href="http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=159">what the research says about CPD</a>, which seems to suggest that effective CPD:</p><br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><li>makes use of peer support</li><br>
<li>makes explicit use of specialist expertise  </li><br>
<li>makes explicit mention of involving the teachers in applying and refining new knowledge and skills and experimenting with ways of integrating them in their day-to-day practice (six studies involved action research)</li><br>
<li>involves consultation with the teachers about their own starting points, the focus of the CPD, the pace of the CPD or the scope of the CPD</li><br>
<li>involves teachers observing one another as an integral part of the CPD</li><br>
<li>involves specialists in observation and reflection (as part of the CPD rather than exclusively focused on data collection).</li></ul><br>
<p align="right">From the EPPI review: <a href="http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=395">What do teacher impact data tell us about collaborative CPD?</a> </p></blockquote><br>
<p>Part of the project has also been about how to make best use of the available technologies to ensure the most effective use of time when we apply these approaches to CPD. </p><br>
<p>As my responsibility has been to facilitate the online components of the project, I've been collecting together ideas from around the world that will be relevant specifically to teacher CPD. You can see these at a Google Reader shared page called <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/10949212512548432704/label/winble-ideas">WinBLE-ideas</a>,</p><br>
<p>As you'll see, there is a vast amount of thinking going about teaching &amp; learning, and how to support that. The ideas collected so far include (among many others): </p><br>

<p>There are many others, and the list is growing...  However the collection does focus a lot on the classroom use of technologies. I'm looking for more examples that are specifically about teacher professional development - especially as they relate to the research above. Any thoughts?</p></div><h1>edublogs: Trying to design the best training event we can</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There is a lot that we in England can learn from our colleagues across the border in Scotland... particularly when it comes to professional development structures for our teachers.<br>
<br>
Ewan describes in <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/trying_to_desig.html">this post</a> the elements that <em>he</em> tries to include within any CPD event that he runs. It includes:<br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Ensuring the the training backup materials are online;</li><br>
  <li>Ensuring that participants can edit and add to the materials with their anecodotes, and help each other out even though they work in different locations;</li><br>
  <li>Ensuring participants have his blog and mobile phone number as a safetynet;</li><br>
  <li>Ensuring that participants could see from the training notes what their next steps might be in terms of training.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Some people would describe this approach as "blended". I'm gradually turning more and more away from that term towards the word "connected". What Ewan is showing here is how to make sure that the CPD opportunity at the event connects with other CPD back at school, or at a later date. But also, using the technologies available it allows people to connect with each other, and, via people's blogs, with other ideas.<br>
<br>
This is where the learning theory known as <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/">Connectivism</a> hits the road and gets put into practice. </div><h1>SCoPE: Seminars: Knowing Knowledge</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://scope.lidc.sfu.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=398#2715">http://scope.lidc.sfu.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=398#2715</a></p>I've been involved (on the edges) of a fascinating international <a href="http://scope.lidc.sfu.ca/course/view.php?id=8">seminar</a> around George Siemen's <a href="http://knowingknowledge.com/">Knowing Knowledge book</a>.<br>
<br>
The discussion is moving into more practical/implementation issues. The theories are fine, but thinking about how we actually make use of them is most important to me at the moment.<br>
<br>
[The following is a forum posting I made in the seminar - reproduced here for my benefit!]<br>
<br>
There are three issues that I see coming to the fore at the moment:<br>
<br>
   1. How do we design centrally-driven learning experiences that incorporate connectivist principles?<br>
   2. How do we make the process of collecting together our personal learning conversations easier.<br>
   3. How do we encourage individuals to take responsibility for their place within their own learning network?<br>
<br>
When I think about the first question I am considering the centre as any organisation (or even another person) that is setting assessment criteria or objectives. Perhaps the answer is that centrally-driven learning doesn't have a place within a learner-centred learning ecology? But that won't fit well with any organisation that I know... My feeling is that organisations need to treat learning experiences more as marketing opportunities. Marketeers try to change behaviour through a range of mechanisms, which include spreading messages &amp; ideas through networks. I think we (as learning professionals) could learn a lot from that.<br>
<br>
Regarding the second question, I think about my own experiences of writing responses to things on my blog, or as comments on other people's blogs, or in forums like this. I also have bookmarks kept in Diigo; three email clients where I keep archives of conversations; as well as various file storage mechanisms. Is the search engine really the only way we can try to keep track of things? What about content and conversations that are hidden behind a login? The concept of the Personal Learning Environment seems beguiling, but for the moment do we need to live with the fact that our online lives are not very easily connected? What happens then to those people who find working online difficult to start with?<br>
<br>
Which leads on to the third question... which is the critical one. All the time individuals treat learning as something external; the responsibility of the organisation to which they belong, then it will be next to impossible to implement connectivist ideas. As someone said somewhere (I've a terrible memory for quotes!) you only realise the benefit of networked learning ideas when you experience it for yourself. So do we wait for the idea to spread organically, or is there a way of pump-priming networked learning. (I've a vested interest in the answer to this... as it's the subject of my Masters dissertation!)</div><h1>edublogs: The importance of creating a network</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Ewan McIntosh strikes again. His post on "<a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/the_importance_.html">The importance of creating a network</a>" resonates totally with me. It's one I wished I'd written, and I'll certainly refer to it during my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/01/09/preparing_for_naace_conference_2007">Naace session</a> on social networking and teacher CPD.<br>
<br>
As <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/">George Siemens</a> writes at the end of his book, "<a href="http://knowingknowledge.com/">Knowing Knowledge</a>":<br>
<blockquote>The future belongs to the network aware.</blockquote><br>
<br>
To me, to be network aware means understanding that I am a node in a network of learners, responsible for developing, maintaining and pruning my own connections to that network. It's through those connections that I am able to rapidly pick up on new developments in my particular field(s), to explore those new developments further and perhaps to change my thinking and my behaviour in the light of those developments.<br>
<br>
My connections into this network take many forms. I'm now much less reliant on face-to-face conferences &amp; events. Although, with <a href="http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/2004/06/checklist-for-assessing-f2f-or-online.htm">Nancy White</a>, I know that face-to-face, when used well, can be a highly effective medium. I have almost no need of the postal network (except when selling on ebay!) Most of my network activity now takes place online (the connections there are much easier to make, and to maintain). Some of it takes place through my <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> contacts list, some through email, most inbound connections are through my RSS subscriptions in Google Reader and most outbound connections through my blog.<br>
<br>
A few months ago I listened to a podcast from Manager Tools about <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/2006/05/building-a-network/">how to build your personal network</a>. One of the things they highlighted in the show was the fact that maintaining a network requires activity... whether it's sending someone an occasional "keeping in touch" email, commenting on a blog, or linking to someone else in your own blog.<br>
<br>
Most of us start by trying to maintain a network that is far beyond our capabilities to maintain. We end up with too much to read, and too much to write. There is always pruning to be done to find the nodes that add the most value to you.<br>
<br>
So what does all this mean?<br>
<br>
There are a number of perpectives to look at networks. The main one is the perspective of the individual node. Where do <b>I</b> fit into it? Who am I connected to? Are they the right people to be connected to? Who is connecting to me? How can I best help the people connected to me?<br>
<br>
But we also need to look at the organisational perpective. Organisations must learn how networks work, and ensure that the conditions exist for the people within the organisation to make the best connections possible. That may mean providing software platforms, but more probably it means providing people resources to act as filters and editors. These people will also become nodes in the network, but, if they are doing a good job and are perceived to be useful nodes, they will rapidly become the hubs around which their people will see the rest of the network.<br>
<br>
Of course, organisations might then choose to manipulate the hubs; to spin the messages hitting their people, but, in a networked world there are always other routes to information &amp; ideas. Basic information literacy requires everyone to always go back to the source before acting on an idea, and always to look at alternative viewpoints.<br>
<br>
This applies to every sort of organisation, whether it's a local authority with its employees, a newspaper with its readers, a company with its customers etc. But remembering, as Ewan so clearly describes, that these people may be members of multiple networks that cross companies, local authorities etc. (Which means that you may end up joining up organisations!)<br>
<br>
So, my proposal, (and roughly the central idea of my Masters dissertation), is that organisations must feed and support the networks that their people  belong to if they wish to retain their positions of power and influence.<br>
<br>
How does that sound? How does your organisation help or hinder your personal learning network?<br>
<br>
<br>
</div><h1>Understanding networks: two perspectives...</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 23 January 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I hadn't planned this, but the two posts I made yesterday:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/01/22/edublogs_the_importance_of_creating_a_ne">edublogs: The importance of creating a network</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/01/22/scope_seminars_knowing_knowledge">SCoPE: Seminars: Knowing Knowledge</a></li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
are coming at networks from two different angles, both of which are vital if we're to a) understand networks within and across organisations, and b) make use of them.<br>
<br>
The first perspective is that of the individual within the network. There are many people who realise that they are part of a networked world, and understand that they need to take responsibility for their part within it. But this group is still very much a minority. <a href="http://growchangelearn.blogspot.com/">Tom Haskins</a>, in his comment, describes them as the "early adopters" - the people who are willing to try new things, and to see the potential benefits rapidly.<br>
<br>
So, there's a job to do here - to "sell" the benefits of networked learning to those "slow adopters" who cannot yet see the benefit it, as compared to the cost.<br>
<br>
The second perspective is that of the organisation, which by not engaging with the network is losing contact with those early adopters who are moving far more rapidly than the organisation can deal with.<br>
<br>
Again, there's a selling job to be done - to persuade organisations that engaging with, and becoming part of, the network is worthwhile.<br>
<br>
So, what would be on your marketing materials for networked learning for these two audiences?<br>
<br>
<br>

</div><h1>Learning, the marketplace, and personalisation</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38265">http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38265</a></p>Stephen Downes talking about <a href="http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/150678.html">Chris Sessums's School 2.0 manifesto</a>:<br>
<blockquote>"learning is not about commerce and it's not about markets."</blockquote><br>
<br>
Well, I'm not sure I agree totally here. You could argue that learning is very much about the marketplace. People that are designing "learning opportunities" (whatever they might be) need to be adept at understanding the market in which they are operating and the factors that will motivate people to engage with those learning opportunities.<br>
<br>
School 1.0 is very much about the centre telling people what they should learn. I would argue that School 2.0 is about the learner having choice &amp; control. Which sort of fits in with the new <a href="http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/default.aspx?PageFunction=productdetails&amp;PageMode=publications&amp;ProductId=DFES-04255-2006&amp;">DfES report on the future of schooling</a>. This has a major focus on personalisation - but I don't think they have understood that real personalisation of learning will mean a major rethink in what we consider "school". How can we personalise when we force <em>who </em>our children work with? How can we personalise when the timetable fixes <em>when </em>they are going to do certain things?<br>
<br>
[Edit: I take it back. Reading the report properly shows that the authors do have a real grasp of the possibilities and the implications. For example, on page 26, they talk about how schools might be reconfigured:<br>

<br>
True personalisation will take place when each learner (not necessarily a child?) has a purpose for what they are learning, and understands that purpose (not just the lesson objectives, but how it fits into their lives at that point in time). They will have control over who they work with, when they work and what resources they use to achieve that purpose.<br>
<br>
Where does the teacher fit in? As a marketeer - persuading, demonstrating, guiding, explaining - but all the time knowing that the learner (or perhaps their parent/guardian) is actually the one in control.<br>
<br>
Is that too idealistic? Perhaps. Will it ever happen? Unlikely without a major shift in the public perception of what learning is all about - that learning is a continuous process - that we'll never have learnt enough - that one of the most important lessons is learning how to learn.</div><h1>Web 2.0 video: We are the machine</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you've seen this before, then please ignore.

<p>One of the tasks I'm going to attempt during this dissertation year is a network analysis of as many edublogger's blogrolls as possible.</p><br>
<p>This is an outline of the process I'm expecting to use behind the scenes to do the analysis:</p><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Collect each person's blogroll in the form of an OPML file (exported from their feedreader, eg. Bloglines, Google Reader, BlogBridge etc)</li><br>
  <li>Collect contextual information about each person sending in an OPML file;</li><br>
  <li>Give each person a unique ID;</li><br>
  <li>Extract the URLs contained within each OPML, by using the <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon<br>
XML parser</a>, with the XSLT from: <a href="http://martinjansen.com/2005/10/19/opml2text.html">http://martinjansen.com/2005/10/19/opml2text.html</a>.<br>
The XSLT processing should create a CSV file containing the sender's ID attached to the URL's they read.</li><br>
  <li>Each CVS file will be added to a database (probably Access - as it's just a rapid development tool I need)</li><br>
  <li>Once all the data is input into the database I will use it to create a file that can be read by the <a href="http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu/software.html">Network<br>
Workbench software</a> - using the format described at: <a href="http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu/NWB_File_Format_v02.html">http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu/NWB_File_Format_v02.html</a><br>
  </li><br>
  <li>Then I just need to analyse the connections... to see if it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network">scale-free<br>
network</a>.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>That's just stage 1 (I think). The next stage will be to find out what it is about the hubs that makes them hubs.</p><br>
<p>The aim is to find out what makes the network tick, so that organisations such as teacher CPD agencies can make best use of it.</p><br>
<p>That's a very waffly, and indeterminate description of the project so far. It will firm up over the course of the next few days &amp; weeks. (I hope!)</p><br>
</div><h1>Will Richardson on "unlearning"</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/the-steep-unlearning-curve/">http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/the-steep-unlearning-curve/</a></p>Will Richardson always brings something into the mix that makes you think. In this post on the <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/the-steep-unlearning-curve/">steep unlearning curve</a> that we (as educators - and as society) must undergo, Will describes a number of the things we need to <b>unlearn</b> in order to "see the possibilities before us".<br>
<br>
These are some of the things he has suggested - with a bit of commentary from me.<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the idea that we are the sole content experts in the classroom, because we can now connect our kids to people who know far more than we do about the material we’re teaching.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
It's a case of us, as educators, moving out of our comfort zone and returning to a state of constant discomfort (=learning)<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the premise that we know more than our kids, because in many cases, they can now be our teachers as well.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Yet I can just see the headlines: "What are we paying our teachers for?" How do we get the message across to a society that believes it knows everything about education?<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the idea that learning itself is an event. In this day and age, it is a continual process.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Tell that to the people leading the assessment practices. No matter how much we dislike it - assessment drives "formal" learning.  All the time assessment is content focussed, time delimited and reliant on what you can remember very little will change.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the strategy that collaborative work inside the classroom is enough and understand that cooperating with students from around the globe can teach relevant and powerful negotiation and team-building skills.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
You could argue that we should just let the kids find their particular communities of practice and then work out which transferable skills are being demonstrated. That would answer the assessment problem. I'm not sure it would answer those people that say everyone needs to have studied Shakespeare's 1st sonnet (not that I know what a sonnet is - my school - a UK grammar school didn't do English Lit - at least not in the 80's!)<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the idea that every student needs to learn the same content when really what they need to learn is how to self-direct their own learning.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Learning how to learn is the absolute critical skill for everyone, I agree. But how do we then give every child the opportunity to explore whether they should take a particular field of learning further, eg. Science, or even Latin? How can we help universities understand that the people coming to them won't necessarily know much about their subject - but they know how to learn?<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the notion that our students don’t need to see and understand how we ourselves learn.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
There's a lot of negatives in there. Are you saying that teachers need to be open about their own learning? If so, I agree totally - but where do we start? And also, there isn't the capacity in the fixed curricula we have (certainly in the UK) to cope with teachers that are continually learning and wanting to try new things. Perhaps we need to take an approach to education that let's people learn from those who are just slightly further on than they are - with the teacher being the person that provides a sense of direction? (Just thinking aloud here really)<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the practice that teaches all students at the same pace. Is it any wonder why so many of our students love to play online games where they move forward at their own pace?<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Yes - this is partly what the recent <a href="http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/default.aspx?PageFunction=productdetails&amp;PageMode=publications&amp;ProductId=DFES-04255-2006">DfES report on 2020 schooling</a> appears to be saying. I'd be interested to get your ideas on what your ideal "school" looks like: how is it organised? Where do things happen? Who does what, when?<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the idea that we can teach our students to be literate in this world by continually blocking and filtering access to the sites and experiences they need our help to navigate.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Yes, it's similar to being streetwise - but the online streets are so new that parents and teachers are struggling to keep up with what it means to be streetwise in this environment.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
We need to unlearn the premise that real change can happen just by rethinking what happens inside the school walls and understand that education is now a community undertaking on many different levels.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
That takes me back to a <a href="http://www.capitaes.co.uk/LearningPlatform/downloads/LP_White_Paper.pdf">white paper I wrote some years ago</a>: <br>
<br>
"When communication via the internet is brought in to a school then, automatically, the physical and temporal walls of the classroom have been broken down. Students and teachers will have access to each other regardless of physical or temporal location. Teachers and learners now have the choice of two environments in which learning may take place, the real and the virtual. It will be up to the teacher to learn how to make most effective use of both those environments, which may mean changing the way the classroom is used because it is not the most appropriate environment for certain learning activities."<br>
<br>
But things have moved on even more than that. The learning platform then was still about one school. These days the network is far wider than just one school, one district, or even one country. Just imagine, if schools really understood the power of the network and the many and varied learning experiences available through it. The trouble I'm having is making that picture concrete - working out what it means in practice...</div><h1>BETT Podcasts</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.bettshow.com/bett/show_podcast.asp">http://www.bettshow.com/bett/show_podcast.asp</a></p>The BETT show seminars have been published in mp3 format (along with associated powerpoints etc).

She looks at the marketing theory &amp; practice that teachers could use, and the learning theory &amp; practice that marketers could use.<br>

This is something I've been going on about for a while. Mainly in a corporate context (<a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2006/11/22/we_want_to_buy_a_learning_module">about learning materials</a>), but it's also true throughout education/learning.

The trouble I have with it, like <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38743">Stephen Downes</a>, is that this list just doesn't reflect the elearning world as I see it (from both corporate and formal learning perspectives).<br>
<br>
Let's take their list of categories, and perhaps add some of our own:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>BEST LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS/ LCMS</li><br>
  <li>BEST HOSTED LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</li><br>
  <li>BEST IT CONTENT</li><br>
  <li>BEST LEADERSHIP TRAINING </li><br>
  <li>BEST SOFT SKILLS CONTENT </li><br>
  <li>BEST COMPLIANCE CONTENT</li><br>
  <li>BEST VIRTUAL CLASSROOM</li><br>
  <li>BEST WEB SEMINAR SOLUTION</li><br>
  <li>BEST OVERALL COLLABORATION </li><br>
  <li>BEST PRESENTATION TOOL </li><br>
  <li>BEST AUTHORING TOOL </li><br>
  <li>BEST SIMULATION SOLUTION </li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Apart from the major product gaps the corporate world seems to have (eg. the Moodle's of this world), they have also totally missed out categories for things like:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Best social-networking environment<br>eg. Elgg, b2evolution</li><br>
  <li>Best collaboration environment<br>eg. Google docs, wikispaces</li><br>
  <li>Best RSS aggregator</li><br>
  <li>Best search engine</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Shouldn't these be identified as important parts of today's individualised learning landscape?<br>

</div><h1>Dissertation Proposal</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've submitted my proposal to Hull, and it's been approved in principle. I'm now reproducing it here, partly so it's in my knowledge base, and partly to get any feedback from the rest of the community.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to be able to tap into the edublogging community to do this research, so any comments or suggestions at this stage would be really useful.<br>
<hr><br>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>
<br>
I am working as a Learning Solutions Architect for Capita Learning &amp; Development. This has a large research &amp; development role.<br>
<br>
Many of our clients are involved in wide-ranging and large-scale professional development programmes with learners who are dispersed nationally. The focus and content of these CPD programmes is often driven centrally. A subsequent cascade approach, using geographically or functionally selected groups, then aims to ensure that the learning (ie. knowledge, skills &amp; behaviours) is achieved in the workforce.<br>
<br>
At its simplest the model adopted may be illustrated as a hub and spoke network.<br>
<br>
The model is, in reality, far more complex, since the relationships involved are not completely one-directional.<br>
<br>
Network structures such as this have been widely studied, and their effects and characteristics explored in detail.<br>
<br>
Authors such as <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~alb/">Laszlo Barabasi</a> and <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely-Brown</a> have suggested that scale-free networks, in which any node can connect to any other node, are far more effective in facilitating change than the hub &amp; spoke model of network. They extend this to propose that any node not connected to the network reduces its capacity to change, or to effect change.<br>
<br>
If scale-free networks can be shown to cost-effectively support change across dispersed communities of practice, then the techniques and practices used in developing the networks will provide powerful tools for many large-scale CPD projects.<br>
<br>
From my experience as a learner about elearning, I know the benefits, and the increased capacity to learn, that I have gained by gradually making connections (through blogs &amp; RSS) with other elearning professionals around the world. This has been entirely learner-driven, yet, by virtue of being part of that community of practice, I have also played a part in disseminating &amp; engaging with ideas promulgated by large organisations.<br>
<br>
This dissertation aims to examine:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>the literature surrounding networks and their use in Continuing Professional Development;</li><br>
  <li>the network structure formed by people that are blogging about education (the basic demographic research that will inform the next stage);</li><br>
  <li>how the edublogging network maps to current models of network behaviour (eg. Scale free, random);</li><br>
  <li>whether certain blogs (whether from individuals or groups) are acting as hubs within the network;</li><br>
  <li>which hubs are those felt to have an impact on professional development;</li><br>
  <li>the reasons why people choose to link to the blogs that are the hubs;</li><br>
  <li>the salient characteristics of those hubs that are seen as having an impact on CPD as compared to other blogs;</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<br>
Through exploring these factors and characteristics, I hope to be answer the question:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“What are the salient characteristics of the hubs that support CPD within a blogging network.”<br>
</blockquote><br>
The context used for this investigation will be the network of people blogging about education (edubloggers). The evidence obtained through this research will be of interest to organisations, such as the DfES and its agencies, which wish to encourage self-directed, reflective and collaborative learning (a policy which is itself based on the research about effective CPD, reviewed by CUREE in their <a href="http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=159">EPPI reviews</a>).<br>
<br>
<strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong><br>
<br>
The structure of the research is intended to follow the pattern of exploration set out above:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Examine the existing research evidence around the question posed</li><br>
  <li>Collect the blogrolls from as wide a sample of edubloggers as possible</li><br>
  <li>Convert the data in the blogrolls to a format suitable for analysis within Indiana University’s Network Workbench</li><br>
  <li>Prepare a survey which will assess whether the hubs that are found are having an impact on individuals’ CPD or not, and the reasons why people link to those particular hubs. This survey will be tested on a small sample before wider use with the blogroll contributors.</li><br>
  <li>Interview a sample of the bloggers who are seen to have the most impact on CPD and who have the most incoming links. Alongside this I will interview a sample of other edubloggers. The questions asked will aim to ascertain the salient characteristics of the “effective” bloggers (eg. Frequency of posts, the content, the style of writing, the motivation of the writer/podcaster to write)</li><br>

</div><h1>Survey Measuring Educators’ Uses of Web 2.0 Tools for Professional Growth</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 15 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was listening to a <a href="http://www.edtechtalk.com/node/1502">podcast from EdTechTalk</a> today (whilst walking the dog - it's my best professional development opportunity!)<br>
<br>
The Women of the Web team were getting set to interview <a href="http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk/index.php">Terry Freedman</a> about his new edition of <a href="http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk/db/web2/">Coming of Age</a>. During the introductions <a href="http://www.mtl-peters.net/blog/">Sharon Peters</a> mentioned that she was doing a presentation (at the Illinois Online Conference) on tapping into online social networks for professional growth.<br>
<br>
As part of the presentation, Sharon has prepared a short <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=963633267540">survey to explore the current use of web2.0-type tools for professional growth</a>. It's very easy to do, and should provide some useful data - which may even persuade those in positions of power that there is value in encouraging online social networking.</div><h1>A head of education that gets it...</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've just come across <a href="http://exc-el.org.uk/blogs/donsblog/about/" target="_blank">Don Ledingham</a>. He's Head of Education for East Lothian council (that's East of Edinburgh - I've just checked).<br>
<br>
The thing that's special about Don as opposed to pretty much every Head or Director of Education (as far as I know), is that he keeps an open, online <a href="http://exc-el.org.uk/blogs/donsblog" target="_blank">Learning Log</a>, which (in his words) "<em>started off simply as a means of recording what I was up to on a day-to-day basis. Since then it’s grown into something which has had, and is having, a profound effect upon my professional practice.</em>"<br>
<br>
I would recommend taking at look at this. It's an inspirational piece of leadership. He's modelling the behaviour that he is expecting from his staff - but not making explicit demands of them.<br>
<br>
He made a post this week about <a href="http://exc-el.org.uk/blogs/donsblog/2007/02/09/what-is-a-learning-logg/" target="_blank">what is a learning log</a>, which I'm going to quote here - it's worth it:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><p>"I suppose it can be captured in a relatively simple tri-colon: “Where you’ve been; where you are; and where you’re going”</p><br>
<p>I’m not talking here of travel in any sort of geographical sense, but more about the journey which relates to our opinions, ideas and perceptions.</p><br>
<br>
<p>A Learning Log&nbsp;imposes a discipline upon the reflective process, which, although it may be going on informally, or tacitally, all of the time, can often be lost in the ‘jungle’ which forms much of our daily, weekly and monthly work.</p><br>
<p>The learning log just gives you that brief - and, for me, ever more valuable, opportunity to step outside and look back upon my practice and direction of travel.</p><br>
<p>The reflective power of the on-line Learning Log is&nbsp;magnified when the contribution of others’ comments&nbsp;is taken into consideration - there so many examples I could point to in this Learning Log where my thinking has been significantly influenced by other’s opinions.</p><br>
<p>The Learning Log therefore provides an invaluable strategic map&nbsp;in that it enables you&nbsp;to retrace your steps and see where you’ve come from, identify where you are at any one point in time and, hopefully, enable you to explore the future in a relatively safe environment.</p><br>
<p>The other, incredibly useful role for the learning log is that it enables you to see connections between various things that you are doing that might not be apparent if they were contained within their normal silos.&nbsp; For me it’s this connecting function that helps me to make sense of some the very disparate things that I do in my day-to-day work.</p><br>
<br>
<p>If this seems focussed upon the benefits to the Learning Logger then that has been deliberate - the benefits of a Learning Log to other people&nbsp;is very much dependent upon the reader’s perception - although one would hope that it might be of some interest."</p></blockquote><br>
Apart from the benefits to Don, I wonder what are the effects of his example on the professional learning culture in East Lothian?</div><h1>A new title</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 February 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Over the past couple of years, this blog has moved away from just being a place where I store a whole load of unrelated thoughts and links...

<br>
There was so much to say, and so much that I had to leave out. The main thrust that I was trying to get across was:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Professional development is (or should be) an essential part of every learning professionals daily life.</li><br>
  <li>Building up a personal, wide network of trusted sources with whom you can engage is a highly effective means of CPD</li><br>
  <li>Using RSS &amp; blogs as the means of building this personal network is extremely efficient and effective.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
But it all starts from the first of these. We need to build a culture where professionals are expected to take responsibility for their own CPD.</div><h1>teemu arina - informal supported by formal learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaycross/420569300/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaycross/420569300/</a></p>Picked this up from <a href="http://informl.com/?p=722">Jay Cross</a>. Most organisations approach informal learning by looking at how it can support formal learning (courses etc). <a href="http://tarina.blogging.fi/">Teemu Arina</a> has taken the opposite viewpoint and put informal learning at the centre.<br>
<br>
But... most organisations have a learning culture (if they have one at all) that is based on formal learning and on training records. Might putting informal learning at the centre be too much of a culture shift?? Or should we be proposing this as the end point, with stages in-between?<br>

That's the thing - it's all about having a <a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/entries/6521819364"><strong>personal </strong>learning environment</a> where you collect together your bunch of trusted information sources and experts, and also have space where you can reflect, have conversations and collaborate. <br>

<br>
But now, via <a href="http://informl.com/?p=724">Jay Cross</a>, there's another option. <a href="http://bubbl.us/">Bubble.us</a> is ideal for  collaborative visual thinking. It's a Flash-based, free, online mind-mapping tool and works extremely well. Not as sophisticated as MindManager or Freemind - but it does the job. Once they get the export bit working it will be even better so you can bring the map into the offline tools for finishing off.</div><h1>Extending the reach of CPD</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've always, in some form or other been involved with schools. Whether this has been as a teacher or someone who supports teachers. Over the past couple of years I've been working with groups of teacher advisors from around England, exploring ways in which they can be more efficient and effective - by making appropriate use of the technology available.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I've become more and more convinced that our personal professional development and our work can be <strong>hugely</strong> enhanced by using easily updateable websites which produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a> (eg. a blog). Convincing people to take the plunge, however, is difficult. Especially when the only examples seem to be always focussing on how technology can support teaching &amp; learning. (Although perhaps that's just a by-product of what happens when you encounter connected learning - it raises a whole host of new possibilities.) <br>
<br>
So what's in it for a teacher advisor? What's the best way of using a website like this? What's going to stop them? What examples are there of people doing it already?<br>
<br>
Let's take a hypothetical Primary Music advisor - we'll call her Jo. Probably the only one in their authority, or possibly even the only one in the whole region. Their job is to "raise standards" in music. Currently this involves running workshops for teachers, working with colleagues on cross-curricular creative projects, hosting network meetings for Music Co-ordinators, possibly working on inspection teams, and being aware of new resources and ideas. She also contributes to the authority's termly advisory team newsletter.<br>
<br>
Jo is seen in her authority as a trusted source of advice and inspiration. Teachers that attend her workshops always come away with some good ideas that they can put into practice immediately.<br>
<br>
Yet Jo is frustrated. She would like to get round to see more people. She would like more people to get to the workshops. She spends a lot of her time sharing what she has learnt and the good practice she has seen, and often feels that she is repeating herself. Time, and Jo's capacity is the issue.<br>
<br>
There are two possible (and complementary) answers to this. One is for Jo to focus on helping people become more independent and motivated learners - so that she is not seen as the fount of all knowledge. The other is to make better use of her time so that valuable face-to-face time is used most effectively.<br>
<br>
So Jo decides to set up a blog. It's not hard. In fact it took her two minutes to create a website that looked good and allowed her to publish text, images, video and audio very easily.<br>
<br>
<strong>Jo</strong> uses the blog to talk about new resources and ideas, and about some of the things she's seen happening around the authority. The <strong>teachers</strong>, (and it's not just the music co-ordinators now) use her blog as a filter for all the information coming at them about Music in the curriculum. She has become their trusted source of information. But the conversation is two-way - as she's opened up her posts for comments. Jo gets feedback and further questions about them - and often from people that she would never have reached otherwise.<br>
<br>
Jo has also showed people how to use feed readers and personal homepage systems such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google reader</a>, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Netvibes</a>. This means that they don't have to keep going to her blog to check for updates. Instead they have a single page which collects together the feeds they want to subscribe to. Adding new feeds is easy, so her teachers could gradually develop their network of trusted sources. The conversation grew wider and began to have more impact.<br>
<br>
The hardest part for Jo was at the beginning. A lot of her colleagues advised her not to go down this route. Public publishing was seen to hold all sorts of dangers and questions about accountability, liability, ownership and copyright. The IT Services department in the authority did not have suitable software on the website that she could use. Her managers did not know how to deal with her publishing without control from higher-up.<br>
<br>
Jo showed her managers the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/advice/weblogswebsites/index.shtml">BBC personal blogging policy</a> which seemed to fit her situation well. She wanted to keep her blog personal, rather than have it as part of the authority's systems so that she would not lose all the valuable knowledge and reflection it contained when and if she moved on. She also showed them some examples of other sites that were being used in similar ways, for example, <a href="http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/cs/blogs/mfle/">Learning &amp; Teaching Scotland's MFL blog</a>, and <a href="http://exc-el.org.uk/blogs/donsblog">East Lothian's Head of Education's blog</a>.<br>
<br>
To help her colleagues understand what she was about she also used part of a team meeting to do the <a href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org/2007/03/16/workshop-activity-paper-blogs/">Paper Blogging exercise</a> designed by Leonard Low. <br>
<br>
Having got permission from her employers, she set up her blog and put on the appropriate disclaimers about it being her own thoughts etc. Jo is very aware that what she writes is public and reflects on her. So she's careful in the opinions she writes, and especially careful with copyrighted material. As a musician Jo understands the need to respect intellectual property. Even though this can sometimes restrict what she publishes - especially when it comes to children's compositions - it doesn't often have a major effect. In fact it's a  teaching point that she uses with children: it's always a good idea to check if you're allowed to use  material within your own compositions. (Hint: Look for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/uk/">Creative Commons license</a>).<br>
<br>
Let's leave Jo for the moment. If you're an ICT advisor it's easy to find examples of people already doing this. There are hundreds of personal websites that are publishing news and ideas about ICT in education. In most other subjects there is a distinct lack of suitable examples. I was looking for one for a Science advisor yesterday and could not find a single blog that focusses on school science. Plenty that look at ICT in Science - but not one that takes Science as a whole.<br>
<br>
There are many (free) ways individuals can set up a blog, eg. <a href="http://edublogs.org/">Edublogs</a>, <a href="http://www.terapad.com/">Terapad</a>, or even use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.<br>
<br>
If, however, anyone is interested in joining <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/">Learning Conversations</a> as a contributing member please let me know. I can give you your own space for you to use and will track and highlight posts in my "editorial". I know the site looks a bit ugly at the moment - I'm working on that.<br>
<br>
To do this properly it needs people who are close enough to the classroom to be authentic, but with enough links across different classrooms to provide a wider perspective.<br>
<br>
There's no money in it - but the personal and professional rewards far outweigh the time it takes to post. If there are enough suitable posts I will consider aggregating them into a paid for download, or print-on-demand service. In which case contributors will get a share of any profits, based on how much of their content is in the final product. I don't see this as a major money-making opportunity though - since ideally people will receive this content for free.<br>

</div><h1>Blogs &amp; Social Media Forum</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Last year's forum on Blogs &amp; Social Media was a really good introduction to the concepts, as well as providing some excellent case studies which could be used when debating the ideas.<br>
<br>
This year's forum has just been announced at: <a href="http://www.socialmediaforum.co.uk/">http://www.socialmediaforum.co.uk/</a>. It's not too expensive as these things go - less than £400 - but worth it.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's not all about learning. It's a cross-over place between learning, marketing, human resources, internal communications, media, publishing, customer support etc. Seeing all these people in the same place was a fascinating experience. That's the thing about social media - it forces us out of our silos.<br>
<br>
(BTW. I've got no commercial relationship with any of the organisers of this conference)</div><h1>Extending the reach of CPD 2</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>In my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/03/28/extending_the_reach">earlier post</a> this week I introduced Jo, a hypothetical (honest!) Primary Music advisor. We saw how she decided that a blog was probably going to be the best way to extend the reach of the CPD that she offers - both geographically and temporally.<br>
<br>
She's been through the discussion with her manager, who has accepted that a personal blog space, under Jo's control, and outside of the Local Authority's network, would be the best way of letting this happen quickly. But Jo was asked to put on the usual disclaimer, seen on many blogs of this sort: "All of the opinions expressed in this blog are mine and are not the opinion of my employer, Middleshire County Council." <br>
<br>
One of the blogs Jo used to persuade her manager that this way forward was going to work was Ian Usher's "<a href="http://moodlea.blogspot.com/">Changing the Game</a>". Which, although focussed on an ICT-related topic, offered exact parallels to the sort of thing she was hoping to achieve:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>the dissemination of good ideas from around the authority (NB. for USA readers, a Local Authority is similar to a school district - although it has responsibilities far wider than just schools);</li><br>
  <li>the dissemination of good ideas and resources brought to Jo's attention from across the Primary Music spectrum</li><br>
  <li>modelling reflective practice - based on principles of <a href="http://www.infed.org/research/b-actres.htm">Action Research</a>;</li><br>
  <li>linking up networks of primary music coordinators and other teachers to explore how music, as part of a "<a href="http://www.primary-teacher-uk.co.uk/2006/07/creative_curric.html">creative curriculum</a>" could enhance basic skills.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
As you can see, Jo has big ideas, but she decided to start small. Over on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/jo">another part of the Learning Conversations site</a>, you can see what her blog might look like. <i>(Please note this is <b>not</b> a real blog!)</i><br>
<br>
Every time she leads a workshop with her colleagues she gives out her blog address as the place to go to keep in touch with developments. (This is used in parallel with the Authority's closed learning platform, where all notes from workshops are placed - in a similar way to Ewan MacIntosh's <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/trying_to_desig.html">model for designing training events</a>.)<br>
<br>
Once or twice a week, sometimes more often, sometimes less, Jo adds a post to her blog which highlights something special or interesting that she's seen in her travels around the authority.<br>
<br>
She also posts briefly about new resources that she's come across. She doesn't have to be online to do this, as her blog is set up so she can post by email, so she can do it offline. One day she'll work out how to do it from her mobile phone but that's for another day...<br>
<br>
It's a lot to expect teachers to remember (or even want) to go to your particular web page every day just to see if there's anything new. So Jo also encourages her colleagues to make use of RSS readers so they don't have to. Using an RSS reader as their homepage means they can quickly catch up with new posts from as wide a range of RSS feeds as they want - a bit like a personalised newspaper.<br>
<br>

</div><h1>My new blog</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I'm Jo - Primary Music advisor for Middleshire County Council. I'm hoping this blog will become a useful resource for me, as I collect together ideas from around the county and elsewhere to support Music teaching &amp; learning.<br>
<br>
I particularly want to focus on the Creative Curriculum - and how we can link together with other parts of the curriculum to enhance basic skills through creative learning.<br>
<br>
So - this is going to be a journey of discovery for me - and hopefully for anyone else reading this.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to comment on the posts. It would be great if this could become a conversation.</div><h1>Creative Curriculum planning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was at Springfields Community Primary school this morning for part of their INSET day. The whole staff was exploring the <a href="http://www.creativelearningjourney.org.uk/">Creative Learning Journey website</a> which was produced by Bexley Council.<br>
<br>
This was the first time the whole staff had had a chance to look at what other schools had done, and to begin to think about how to implement a skills-based curriculum.<br>
<br>
We used some of the video resources from the QCA Futures programme: http://www.qca.org.uk/12933.html to think about why we might need to rethink the curriculum, and also investigated how Tasmania has approached curriculum change with their Essential Learnings: http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/<br>
<br>
It was a hard day, which raised lots of questions. We agreed that we couldn't see how the personalisation agenda could be implemented effectively without a wholesale change in how we work, how the school (and particularly its timetable) is organised. But making such a change is not an overnight thing. Communication is going to be key, with parents and the community to engage.<br>
<br>
The next stage is to talk to some of the other schools in the authority who are slightly further ahead in the process. </div><h1>Sir Robert Hitcham's Primary School</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 March 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you're struggling for ideas in your Music curriculum, I'd suggest going to the <a href="http://www.hitchams.suffolk.sch.uk/schoolweb/music.htm">Sir Robert Hitcham's Primary School website</a>.<br>
<br>
It's full of ideas and resources particularly around ways of integrating Music, ICT, Art, Drama and Dance.</div><h1>Professional learning - lessons learned</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 December 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>For the past couple of years, I've been working on an extended project which has investigated the extent to which organisations can create CPD (continuous professional development) opportunities which have impact and reach beyond the training room.<br>
<br>
These are some of the lessons I've learned from it. It's not designed to be a fully-fledged evaluation - just my initial thoughts.<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>When embarking on a “course” of CPD that is longer than a one-off intervention it needs to be carefully matched to the priorities and expectations of the people who will be involved. This matching needs to be a continual process throughout the course, especially if there is a learner-driven element such as online interactions or accessing resources. If the learners feel, at any time, that the “course” is not meeting their priorities or their expectations, they are likely to drop-out, or to only engage in those parts that they feel most comfortable with (most likely the face-to-face components).</li><br>
  <li>If a forum will be an <em>essential</em> component of the communication plan, then email subscriptions (Moodle terminology) to the forum should be enforced, rather than be made optional.</li><br>
  <li>Although blended learning has been equated to choice, we need to be clear about which elements of the blend are essential components and which are optional.<br>
</li><br>
  <li>Every CPD opportunity needs to have a clear communication plan which will set out the purpose of the opportunity, what people will be expected to gain from it, and what participants will be expected to do within it. The plan should indicate how the inidividual participants concerned will be communicated with.<br>
</li><br>
    <li>When working with people who are new to working online, a face-to-face session at the very beginning is essential. To set priorities and expectations, and to introduce people to why and how they will be communicating online. This could even be a partially paper-based session (similar to, for example, the Paper Blogging exercise described at: http://mlearning.edublogs.org/2007/03/16/workshop-activity-paper-blogs/ <br>
</li></ul><br>
<br>
The most important thing out of all of these is setting expectations and generating motivation. This is critical for any medium to long term CPD experience - especially those with an online element, where the learner is in total control of their experience.</div><h1>Quick wins in Knowledge Management</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2007/03/29.html#a1821">http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2007/03/29.html#a1821</a></p>Dave Pollard has put together a very useful description of some of the things that organisations can do to quickly to improve knowledge management.<br>
<br>
They include:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Setting up a quick list of people who have been recommended as experts - along with the list of their recommenders</li><br>
  <li>Showing people how to manage their personal  information - using desktop search tools and simple file naming conventions</li><br>
  <li>Providing cheat sheets which allow people to make good choices about which communication tool to use</li><br>
  <li>Providing ways of people easily publishing their knowledge and subscribing to others'. (I can recommend <a href="http://www..b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> for this...</li><br>
  <li>Teaching people how to do research, not just search</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
And it's not just the list of things he suggests that is useful. It's the links to resources like "<a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2007/02/06.html#a1773">When not to use email</a>" that I can see being used over and over again.</div><h1>Extending the reach of CPD 3: Science</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 April 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Kate Blacklock, at <a href="http://www.educationexcellence.co.uk/team.php">Education Excellence</a> has emailed me the link to their new Science blog: "<a href="http://science.yourlearningspace.org/">Told you science wasn't boring</a>".<br>
<br>
It illustrates perfectly the sort of thing I've been talking about. It's a place where the science team at Education Excellence can quickly post ideas and examples from their work. It means that their relationship with schools can extend beyond the training room.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of the team blog for this. It means you can still have a personal blog which you own, but have the team blog owned by the organisation. It also spreads out the effort a bit - you don't need to update it quite so often if there are other people doing it as well.<br>
<br>
Trouble is, most local authorities don't have curriculum teams like this any more - although perhaps there's a case for leading practitioners or advanced skills teachers within an authority to get together to create a blog for their particular area of expertise?<br>
</div><h1>How small is a school?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 23 April 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>I'd already been musing this weekend about schools, and small schools (secondary as well as primary) in particular, when I came across <a href="http://internettime.com/?p=840">Jay's post</a> where he asks the question:</p><br>
<blockquote>Will we need schools when we can learn directly from life?</blockquote><br>
<p>The current thinking with schools seems to be the bigger the better. But, with pretty much ubiquitous learning available using our networks (and that sentence can deliberately be read in many ways), is there a case to say let's reconsider the purpose and practicality of small schools?</p><br>
<p>Such schools appear to be suffering widespread closures (according to the <a href="http://www.smallschools.org.uk/">National Association of Small Schools</a>), often removing another important factor that maintains community cohesion and viability. So, is there a model of small school that maintains quality and, at the same time, is financially realistic?</p><br>
<p>It depends really what you mean by "school"...</p><br>
<p>If a school is an isolated, entirely self-sufficient entity, which contains all the resources necessary to support the learning of all the people within its boundaries, then no.</p><br>
<p>But, if a school is part of a wider network, with resources (people and knowledge) available as required then perhaps yes.</p><br>
<p>The prevailing culture in the UK is for all schools to become <a href="http://www.specialistschools.org.uk/">specialist schools</a>, which means (to me) that, in order to provide the breadth and depth of education required, they have to work with other schools with other specialisms.</p><br>
<p>At the other end of the scale, we see, via the blogging network, self-motivated independent learners who have particular specialisms supporting others in a share and share alike learning economy.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps small schools could sit in the middle of these two extremes - they could each have a teacher or two with a particular specialism, that is used to support the network of schools. The teacher's main role would be as a coach, as a facilitator of learning, as an expert in how to learn and in societies expectations of learners.</p><br>
<p>There are lots of questions to answer before this model would be accepted:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>How will the money work? Who pays for what?</li><br>
<li>It will rely on a network of teachers who are committed to this model of learning. Each node on the network will need to be a productive node if it is to remain valuable to the network. So do we start from within the existing system? Or from outside it?</li><br>
<li>What happens about the practical aspects of learning where you need to be working closely with an expert in that particular field to build up confidence and skill, eg. music, science, PE? I still can't see how that would work in a network model. Unless the peripatetic system extended to include every subject, not just music lessons, or behavioural support. So you'd have a set of travelling teachers.</li><br>
<li>What about the admin side of things? Could that be centralised to get the economies of scale?</li><br>
<li>What about the informal staffroom conversations? Is it more easy to be lonely in a small school than a large one?</li><br>
<li>What about the social education that children get by interacting with a larger community?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>In my mind, a skills-led curriculum, in which children learn transferable skills for living and learning, is a much better fit to a networked-learning model than a content-led curriculum. But is that a change too far?</p><br>
<br>

<br>
I hope he doesn't mind but I've reproduced the diagram here:<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/web2collabmethodology.jpg" alt="Methodology for collaboration ideas adoption - from Dave Pollard" title="Methodology for collaboration ideas adoption - from Dave Pollard" width="450" height="498"><div class="image_legend">Source: <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/categories/businessInnovation/2007/04/25.html">Dave Pollard</a></div></div><br>
<br>
There's a whole load of detail under each one of these. But for me, the critical one is the three groups of champions:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>the organization's thought leaders – people who, regardless of seniority or title, are considered innovative and 'ahead of the curve',</li><br>
  <li>current users of web 2.0 applications – kids who use blogs and wikis and RSS feeds and mindmaps and forums and people-finders and social bookmarkers and all the other social networking tools, and can get the others up to speed on how and when to use them effectively, and</li><br>
  <li>'respected sponsors' – people whose use of new collaboration methods and tools will raise eyebrows and get others on-board for fear of falling behind, and who will invest the time to use these methods and tools continuously and regularly, not just during a one-shot launch. </li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
It's a case of getting bottom-up, middle-out and top-down all happening at the same time. Oh, if only it were that simple!<br>

</div><h1>RSS, Blogs and other stuff in corporate learning and development</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 October 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I ran a couple of workshop sessions yesterday, looking at the role that RSS &amp; Blogs in particular can play in corporate learning &amp; development.<br>
<br>
The first one ran pretty much to <a href="http://learningconversations.wikispaces.com/glasgow10_05_07">plan</a>, and seemed to go down well. The second, however, with a much smaller group, and with people who have known each other for a while, moved away from the plan even before it started... Rather than a led workshop session, with preset activities and content, it became a focussed conversation - which, to me, is probably one of the most effective learning experiences you can have.<br>
<blockquote>Facilitating meaningful conversation is the most powerful thing you can do to improve informal learning.<br>
<a href="http://informl.com/?p=625">Jay Cross</a></blockquote><br>
It was a real mix of people, from technophobes to technophiles - but all had expertise and interest in developing organisations and management.<br>
<br>
The conversation focussed very much on the <em>people</em> aspects of technology: why people use it, why they don't, what happens when they do etc.<br>
<br>
I came away with three core ideas that have been milling around my head for a while. They're not at all original, better people than me have written about them at some point or other. But they are three "principles" that I think we need to adopt when introducing people to learning online.<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li><em>Know your sources</em>: In the past we only had the mainstream media as sources of information. They lived or died on their reputation, and you sort of knew what you were getting - what their biases were etc. Now, anyone can be a media publisher. How do we know that we can trust what we read? It's all about knowing your sources - has that person been recommended to you? Have they cited their sources so you can go back to the original source? Have their opinions proved right/useful in the past?</li><br>
  <li><em>Assume nothing you write is private</em>: A general rule of thumb for me is that I assume that every email, forum post etc could, potentially, at some point in the future be made public. Once it's written and posted it's out of my control. Write with that in mind and you'll be safe.</li><br>
  <li><em>The learner is in control</em>: In a classroom/training room/meeting room the group leader/teacher/trainer is in control, can guide the interactions and activities that take place, and when they occur. Move online and the learner takes over. They can switch off, fast forward, engage more deeply, respond etc when and how they choose. So the first question becomes not which learning activity or resource should I use here, but what's in it for my learners - what is going to motivate them to engage with and act on what I'm putting forward. People designing learning experiences with an online element actually need to <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/02/12/marketing_aamp_education">become good at marketing first</a>.</li><br>
</ol><br>

This provoked quite a bit of debate in the first group, as they tried to pick out the key points:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="./assets/Should_every_learning_professional_have_a_blog1.jpeg"><img width="400" src="./assets/Should_every_learning_professional_have_a_blog1.jpeg" alt="Mind map of key points about should learning professionals be blogging" title="Mind map of key points about should all learning professionals be blogging"></a></div><h1>What sort of professional am I?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 May 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was in a meeting today where one of the people present said something along the lines of... "... in our world as HR professionals ..."<br>
<br>
An HR professional? Is that me? I didn't recognise myself in that description at all. I've always (well since I realised I wanted to teach) thought of myself as a "<em>learning</em> professional". Where learning is something you do for its own sake and for the sake of the individual.<br>
<br>
In my head, HR is something that's done on behalf of the organisation. It's how you manage your Human Resources - just as you might manage paperclips. (Ouch - that's perhaps a bit of a jaundiced view!)<br>
<br>
So - am I a learning professional - or an HR professional? I suppose it depends on the context, and who I'm talking to. I have to take both viewpoints. Especially as it's normally the client organisation (and often the HR department) that's paying my wages. But, with my learning professional hat on, I'm always on the side of the learner - trying to make sure that what I do will be of real benefit to them as individuals (at the same time as helping the organisation achieve its aims).<br>
<br>
An interesting balance to work on... </div><h1>SATs - why, oh why, oh why?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 May 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>SATs (tests) - one of the wonders of the English educational system. They start in year 2 (age 6/7), and go on year after year, in various guises until the children leave school.<br>
<br>
I've never quite worked out why we put so much effort into preparing children for them. Parents buy practice books. Teachers give up their holidays (paid thankfully) to do booster classes. Often children miss out on other (untested - but theoretically just as important) parts of the curriculum in order to get better SATs results.<br>
<br>
What a waste of time. If they were <em>really</em> designed to properly measure pupil's performance we should not be allowed to prepare for them apart from the normal education the school offers. Children should not even know they are being tested.<br>
<br>
Preparing children for the SATs is just playing the system. It has no benefit to the children at all. It simply raises the number of children achieving level 2 or 5 (the optimum levels at year 2 and year 6) - and therefore increases the school's position in the league tables. In fact, I think that it actually causes harm because it gives the next teacher or the next school a higher starting point than is truly the case. Which either means the children are given inappropriate work, or the receiving teacher/school is under increased and unreal pressure to add value to the next set of results.<br>
<br>
It's a target-led cycle that is not helping anyone. Personally, I would like to see it stop.<br>
<br>
Please note - this is my opinion only and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of any organisation to which I am currently attached.<br>
<br>
However, as always, I am prepared to learn - and therefore to change my opinion. So don't just all agree with me. Argue. Make me work for my opinion! :-)</div><h1>Future of Education conference - hope and dreams</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'm really looking forward to the <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/learning_technologies/conferences/foe/">Future of Education conference</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/">George Siemens</a> and the University of Manitoba team run brilliant online conferences. They know the importance of keeping people regularly informed of what's going on and the key places to look. Every day an email comes from George picking out the interesting conversations. These, the emails from the discussion forums, and the RSS feeds from people blogging, keep the buzz going. From all sides participants are encouraged to engage with the ongoing dialogue.<br>
<br>
Most conferences are centred on the presentations. The conversations around the edges, although they're usually seen to be the most important part of the conference, are seen as peripheral by the organisers. In these online conferences, the conversations are at the centre. They are the main learning occasions - and treated as such by the organisers. The presentations are just the sparks for those conversations.<br>
<br>
Already the conference has been a learning experience for me. Even before I've really engaged with anyone else! In the <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=145">Introductions thread</a>, I put in writing something that has been part of my thinking for quite a while. I was thinking about what I dream about in education/learning:<br>
<br>
"My dream is to be able to put into practice a holistic view of learning, that is not driven (and therefore constrained) by top-down, arbitrary and simplistic targets. It will be a world where the distinction between teacher and learner is blurred, and where the walls of the classroom are not a barrier for learning."<br>
<br>
That encapsulates most of what I believe about learning (at the moment...) It's necessarily quite vague and general. But hopefully will be useful enough to provide a heuristic against which I can measure how things are going.</div><h1>Chris Sessums - on teacher education, learning technologies and social media</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://eduspaces.net/csessums/weblog/169433.html">http://eduspaces.net/csessums/weblog/169433.html</a></p>Chris has clearly described how learning technologies are being used to support/enhance teacher development at the University of Florida. It outlines how they are using the technology to support both face-to-face and fully online learning programmes.<br>
<br>
There's obviously a lot of detail underneath this - but it shows what is possible and illustrates some of the reasoning behind the choices they made.</div><h1>Notes from the Future of Education Conference: Chris Sessums</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=12">http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=12</a></p>Chris Sessums on the future of teacher professional development: reconnecting people &amp; practice (<a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2007-06-04.1109.M.BB2E854755AAFFF4E1A3E2523C4E54.vcr">Elluminate presentation available)</a>. The sound quality is not brilliant - but not impossible. It means you have to listen hard - not such a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Chris's blog is at: http://elgg.net/csessums/weblog/<br>
<br>
He started by focussing on the school as a community <strong>for</strong> practice. Schools must be more than a place for instruction or knowledge sharing. It must be a place where community members can find support, explore, play and negotiate their practice - all the while remaining <strong>congruent</strong> (brilliant term that) with the institution's policies and procedures.<br>
<br>
Teacher professional development should not be additional - it should be part of what we do as a teacher.<br>
<br>
There is scant research about how new media is being used to support teacher professional development. Chris suggested that we need to "move beyond the blog" to get our experiences written up.<br>
<br>
Chris outlined some of the ways that new media, ie. blogs, wikis, RSS feeds etc, support teacher professional development. He focussed quite a bit on the skills that it develops, such as writing, synthesizing, problem solving, negotiation, team building, leadership, judgement, discernment, responsibility. All of which are critical parts of what it means to be a learner (or citizen) in the 21st Century.<br>
<br>
How do we get educators to participate in the new media environments? One at a time - bottom up, or top down mandate?<br>
<br>
Chris proposes that one of the main influencing factors will be allowing teachers to take more control. Teacher development and curriculum development are closely intertwined. If teachers are merely implementers of curriculum guidelines then professional development is unlikely be very relevant to them.<br>
<br>
Individual teachers <em>can</em> make changes. It requires them to be first comfortable and confident with the technology. Once they are comfortable and confident users they will become <strong>creative</strong> users.<br>
<br>
Chris sees the new media technologies as a way of bridging the communities of practice with the academic teacher education communities.<br>
<br>
Who will lead the development of these communities? Should it be the teacher education institutions? Should we just leave it to happen organically? Should it be the policy makers?<br>
<br>
Successful (organised) CoP's survive as long as someone is there to manage it (or, perhaps, more to act as the editor/filter/pivot around which the community will work)<br>
<br>
I think that's the role that the institutions should play.<br>
<br>
<br>
</div><h1>Changes in the last ten years</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>In the <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=157">Future of Education conference</a>, George Siemens asked: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>	Earlier this week, we explored “what education will look like in 10 years. Perhaps, to gain an increased respect for how much thing have already changed, a moment of nostalgia will help set the stage for our conference:<br>
<br>
What has changed for you as an educator in the last 10 years? Before Google. Blogs. Creative Commons. Wikis. Popularization of open source. Dotcom bust. Hype - Web 2.0, long tail, flat world. What are you doing different from 10 years ago? Go ahead, take the walk through the dark alley of technologies and social pressures of days gone by… </blockquote><br>
<br>
My initial response:<br>
<br>
For me the biggest change has not been in my role as an "educator". I've always been trying new ways of supporting teaching, and helping my learners to interact with each other, rather than relying on me, the "teacher".<br>
<br>
What has changed totally is my perception and my practice as a learner.<br>
<br>
I have changed from expecting learning to be something that is provided. If I need to learn something, I now expect to actively seek out ways to learn it. In some ways I am a more self-sufficient learner. But also, I am more reliant on other people than ever before. It's just those people are officially my teachers/mentors/coaches. They are simply part of the informal, organic, networked communities of practice that I inhabit.</div><h1>Integrating Moodle and ExponentCMS</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>During the past couple of weeks I've been working on building a major intranet site. It's based on two systems (<a href="http://www.exponentcms.org/">ExponentCMS</a> and <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>), which naturally brings the challenge of providing a seamless experience for users.<br>
<br>
As with all integrations there are two parts to it:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>User login</li><br>
<li>Look &amp; feel</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
With Moodle, getting half-way to the utopia of single-sign-on is quite easy. You just configure it to look at the ExponentCMS database for usernames and passwords. Users then register once (in ExponentCMS) and use the same username/password on the Moodle part of the site.<br>
<br>
It's still not seamless; single-sign-on is currently just a dream. But at least it feels partially unified.<br>
<br>
The look and feel is slightly harder... I started with creating the HTML/CSS template, based on the client's design requirements - but then this needs translating into both an ExponentCMS and a Moodle theme. ExponentCMS is extremely flexible with regards to layout and design. There really are no constraints as you've got total control over the main template and also over the way each of the modules (such as menus, breadcrumbs etc) display.<br>
<br>
Out of the box, most of ExponentCMS's modules have table based layouts. I've managed now to create CSS (ie. far more accessible) versions of most of the important ones, like top and side menus.<br>
<br>
Moodle, in comparison, is far less-flexible. It has a fixed layout of header, three columns (laid out with a table), and a footer. But alongside that is a hugely comprehensive CSS structure that allows the designer control over every aspect of display (except that basic layout). So, with a bit of work and hunting around for the right part of the CSS file to edit, it's possible to make a Moodle site match most other CSS-based websites.<br>
<br>
The thing I've always struggled with is how to provide a consistent navigation interface for users - so they can easily jump between the two systems. Up till now, I've got over this problem by creating a hard-wired version of the top menu inside the Moodle header. This has a major disadvantage - in that, if the menu changes in the ExponentCMS part of the site, it needs to be manually changed in the Moodle part. Not friendly!<br>
<br>
So, I took the plunge, and decided to learn how to get the Moodle site to read the ExponentCMS database. It wasn't as hard as I feared. It could easily be translated to use any CMS that works with pages in a hierarchical structure (eg. Etomite).<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
&lt;!-- To create a Moodle top-menu from ExponentCMS section data --&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- Mark Berthelemy - 14th June 2006 --&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- www.learningconversations.co.uk --&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- ############################### -&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;!-- start a div to hold the top menu --&gt;<br>
&lt;div id="topmenubar"&gt;<br>
<br>
	&lt;!-- it's list-based - like all good menus, which means it degrades well --&gt;<br>
	&lt;ul&gt;<br>
<br>
		&lt;!-- Make a connection to the exponent database --&gt;<br>
		&lt;!-- Use the same settings as your ExponentCMS site --&gt;<br>
		&lt;?php<br>
<br>
			// SETTINGS TO CHANGE <br>
			<br>
			$expdbhost = 'localhost';<br>
			$expdbuser = 'root';<br>
			$expdbpass = '******';<br>
			$expdbname = 'exponent';<br>
<br>
			// A relative link to the base URL. The index.php?section= is critical<br>
			$exponenturl = '/exponent/index.php?section=';<br>
<br>
			// END OF SETTINGS TO CHANGE<br>
<br>
			// Make the connection to the database host<br>
			$expconn = mysql_connect($expdbhost, $expdbuser, $expdbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');<br>
<br>
			// But don't make a permanent connection to the exponent database. This will break the Moodle connection.<br>
<br>
			// Retrieve all the data from the "Section" table of the exponent database<br>
			$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM $expdbname.exponent_section WHERE Parent =0",$expconn); <br>
<br>
			// store the record of the "example" table into $row<br>
			while ($row = mysql_fetch_array( $result )) {<br>
<br>
				// Print out the contents of the entry as a list<br>
				echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="'.$exponenturl.$row['id'].'"&gt;'.$row['name'].'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';<br>
			}<br>
		?&gt;	<br>
	&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
	<br>
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- end of top menu bar --&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;!-- END --&gt;<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
How did I learn that? I skimmed a couple of web-based tutorials about connecting to mysql databases. I searched for people who'd tried to connect to multiple databases at once and picked up on the problems they'd had. I got examples from the php.net and mysql.com sites on how to create queries and extract the data as a list. And now I'm recording it here so I don't forget, and to help other people going through the same process.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't have got to this point by attending a mysql course, or reading a linear book. I started with a problem and looked for answers to that specific problem. In the process I've also gained generic, transferable knowledge about dealing with mysql &amp; php.<br>
<br>
Is this an approach that only applies to programming? I don't think so. However, the programming community seems much more easy about sharing knowledge than any other community I'm part of. Without that open sharing of problems and answers I would have probably given up and gone back to the old way of creating these menus manually.<br>
<br>
The thing about programming is that it's a creative activity, and it's not difficult to achieve some results quickly. Which means it lends itself to an apprenticeship model of learning extremely well. John Seely-Brown &amp; John Hagel explore this further in their paper "<a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/pushmepullyou4.72.pdf">From Push to Pull - Emerging Models for Mobilizing Resources</a>".<br>

<h3>RSS (or web feeds) in plain English</h3><br>
<br>
It's hard work keeping up with what everyone's doing. Especially if you have to go to their website just to see if they've added something new.<br>
<br>
The video below explains, in three minutes, how using RSS (aka web feeds) can help.<br>

<h3>Setting up a feed reader</h3><br>
There are a number of ways to set up a feed reader. You could choose to have a program installed on your computer, or you could choose to use one that is web-based.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of this training session it's easier to start with a web-based reader. At the moment, I recommend Google Reader - the video below gives a quick introduction to it.   <br>

<br>
<h3>Subscribing to some feeds</h3><br>
<br>
There are a number of ways to subscribe to feeds within Google Reader:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>If you know the address of the feed (often ending in something like /rss.xml) to which you want to subscribe, you can just click on the "Add Subscriptions" link and paste the address in the text field that appears.</li><br>
<li>Some sites, like this one, have an "Add to Google" button (<a title="Add to Google" href="http://fusion.google.com/add?feedurl=http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark?tempskin=_rss2"><img src="./assets/add.gif" alt="Add to Google" title="Add to Google"></a>). If you click on this you will be taken automatically to Google Reader to subscribe.</li><br>
<li>Or you can copy the address of the website  and paste it in Google Reader's "Add subscription" box. If there's a feed associated with the page, it will be added to your subscriptions.</li><br>
<li>Or look for a link or a button that indicates a feed is available (eg. <img src="./assets/feeds_icon.jpg" alt="RSS icon" title="Feeds icon" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;<img src="./assets/feeds_rss2.jpg" alt="XML icon" title="RSS icon" width="29" height="17">). Click on this link and copy the contents of the address bar into the Add Subscriptions text box. The page that comes up when you click on the link might look full of strange code but Google Reader will display it properly.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<blockquote><br>
Start with this site - and subscribe to it. If you use the Add to Google button it will open in a new window. Then pick out some of the websites that interested you from page 1 and subscribe to them.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Move on to the next page when you are ready.<br>
<!--nextpage--><br>
<br>
<h3>Keeping up-to-date</h3><br>
<br>
There are lots of other useful sites that produce web feeds that you can subscribe to:<br>
<br>
Most newspapers and media organisations will syndicate their news as web feeds. Some may even produce different feeds for different categories of news.<br>
<br>
Many sites (eg. <a href="http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/index.html">Guardian job search</a>, <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/">Google news search</a>, and <a href="http://www.blogdigger.com/index.html">Blogdigger</a>) will produce a web feed for any search you do. This allows you to automatically pick up new items that are fit your search terms.<br>
<br>
A lot of the educators listed on page 1 also encourage their pupils to contribute to similar sites. These produce web feeds which allow them to connect with other classes. For example, start with <a href="http://class3hcefnfforest.blogspot.com/">Paul Harrington's Class 3H site</a>, and follow the links to their friends (down on the right hand side).<br>
<br>
Now you've covered a lot of the practical parts of this workshop, your facilitator will take you through some of the implications of using web feeds to support your professional development and your practice.<br>
<br>
<!--<br />
<h3>Keeping organised</h3><br />
<br />
Google Reader allows you to organise your feeds into folders and by applying "tags" (or keywords).<br />
<br />

--&gt;</div><h1>Manager Tools - an intriguing business model</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager-tools.com</a> is probably the best resource I've found for understanding how to work better with people. Their weekly podcasts provide clear guidelines for specific situations, but within a well thought out management framework that has coaching and feedback at its centre. I don't listen to all of them; just the ones that grab my interest or are particularly relevant at the time.<br>
 <br>
The style is conversational. The content is easy to apply. It suits me (as a regular <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a> - ie. talk radio - listener). It won't suit everyone.<br>
 <br>
The thing that intrigues me is their business model. They give away their key ideas as they apply in generic contexts, but seem to have made a successful business out of working with organisations to apply those ideas in specific situations. As a marketing strategy it's inspired and very brave. The vibrant community of practice that is developing around the Manager-Tools website illustrates the success of those key ideas, without needing case studies full of marketing-speak.<br>
 <br>
<p align="center">Grow the community = grow the business</p></div><h1>Web 2.0 and your own learning &amp; development</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 20 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> was the first person I encountered who was thinking out loud about learning <strong>outside</strong> the confines of an institution. His daily newsletter was a jumping off point for a totally new learning experience for me. I discovered dozens and then hundreds of people who were all thinking out loud. They were exploring new ways of "doing" learning and and realising that the paradigm that says learning takes place mainly in a classroom is unnecessarily restrictive and, in many cases, just doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Stephen's recent addition to the ongoing debate is an ingenious Powerpoint (Keynote?) with video of Stephen talking embedded on each slide. That, in itself, makes it an interesting experience.<br>
<br>
Once you're past the presentation style, and focussing on the content, things get really interesting.<br>
<br>
Stephen has taken an article he wrote a couple of years ago on "<a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/13">Principles of Effective E-Learning</a>". In this, he explores his view that "the keys to effective e-learning are interaction, usability and relevance". The video then takes it further. Stephen shows that it's now possible for the learner (using simple, freely available technology) to take control of their own learning, and be at the centre of their personal network.<br>
<br>
Like <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002964.html">George Siemens</a>, I <em>did</em> like the idea of the "guerilla tactics" for interaction. If your lecturer/trainer/teacher doesn't provide a means of interacting with your fellow learners both during a face-to-face session and outside it, then just do it yourself. I can't see that going down well in the traditional bastions of "learning". Just imagine what would happen if congregations in church started discussing teaching points during the sermon! Or during a lecture in a University? And what would happen if those discussions carried on afterwards, on the open web, so we can get other points of view? And what if we were able to invite the expert/teacher to an interview that was recorded so everyone could benefit? Hmmm. I can feel the walls breaking down now!<br>
<br>
Stephen talks about making your own learning "usable" - by taking responsibility for the way you learn. There's nothing new here really. Throughout history, good learners have used notebooks to keep a record of what they're learning. The difference now is that we can use the technology to make it easier to <strong>search</strong> those records and to <strong>interact</strong> with other people. I disagree totally with his suggestion to use <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> as a content management sytem for handling a personal knowledgebase though. Yes, fine if you've got days to learn how to configure it. But not a suggestion for someone new with these tools. Something like <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> is ideal if you want to manage it yourself. Or go for a hosted option like <a href="http://edublogs.org/">Edublogs</a>, <a href="http://eduspaces.net/">Eduspaces</a> or <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">Wikispaces</a>. They've all got different characteristics, so you might need to explore a bit before deciding on which type of tool to use.<br>
<br>
One of the main points I pickup of from the video was a reminder to "filter ruthlessly". This is something I don't do enough of. So, I'm off to clear out my Google Reader account, so I'm not swamped...<br>
<br>
Here's the video:<br>

[gvid]-5431152345344515009[/gvid]</div><h1>What's in it for me?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>What's in it for me? That sounds so selfish! But it's how we prioritise. We do it every day - all the time. Whether it's a conscious decision or not; we always decide to do things on the basis of whether we think it's going to good for us or good for something/someone that we are linked to.<br>
<br>
That's why it is <strong>so</strong> important that we ensure the learning experiences we design are absolutely explicit about what learners will get out of it, and what's expected of them.<br>
<br>
Learning designers (and I include teachers in this group) like to work with objectives. It's what we've been trained to do. They set the boundaries and the reasons for designing a particular learning experience.<br>
<br>
We assume that learners will like objectives just as much as we do. So we copy them onto the board at the beginning of lessons, or put them in our course catalogues. How much does that really set the learners' expectations? Does that give them enough  so they know (really know) what's in it for them?<br>
<br>
I've <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/06/18/manager_tools_an_intriguing_business_mod">mentioned the Manager Tools team before</a>. I was listening to their recent show about their forthcoming conference. I can't go - it's in Texas. But here's what I know about it already:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>It's two days long</li><br>
  <li>It's in September</li><br>
  <li>Only 100 people will be able to attend</li><br>
  <li>It will be an intensive two days</li><br>
  <li>The last conference was a life-changing experience for many people (based on the comments on the forum)</li><br>
  <li>The days will be very long (compared to the UK - where people expect to start around 10am and finish about 3:30pm)</li><br>
  <li>There will be lots of opportunity to get all my questions answered by an expert in management</li><br>
  <li>I know he's an expert from listening to the other shows, and seeing the answers to questions on the forum</li><br>
  <li>The sessions will take the ideas already discussed on other shows, and help me to apply them in practice</li><br>
  <li>I will be expected to practice the skills discussed</li><br>
  <li>There will be lots of practice</li><br>
  <li>There will be coaches sitting in on the practice sessions to help me develop</li><br>
  <li>There will be breaks every hour</li><br>
  <li>I will make lots of contacts</li><br>
  <li>I will be able to follow up on the forum afterwards</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
So, at this point, I already know far more about this event and what I'll get out of it than any other formal learning experience I've had.<br>
<br>
I've not just got a list of objectives and speaker biographies. I know exactly what it's going to be like.<br>
<br>
I can make a proper decision whether to invest my time/money/effort in attending. If it was in the UK, I could certainly argue the business case for it now.<br>

</div><h1>Interaction or Engagement?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 June 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I don't like "corporate" elearning. By that I mean the typical "click next to continue" multi-media learning resource - whether it's diversity training, health &amp; safety, induction etc. I cannot remember any occasion when I've managed to get through from start to finish.<br>
<br>
Yet, yesterday I spent a good 3/4 hour watching <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5431152345344515009">Stephen Downes's video presentation on web 2.0 and your own learning &amp; development</a> and then <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/06/20/web_2_0_and_your_own_learning_aamp_devel">reflecting</a> on it.<br>
<br>
I will happily work through a mono-media (ie. all text) tutorial on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">w3schools on XML</a>. I will listen to (and learn from) a 30 minute podcast on the <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/2006/12/presentation-basics-principle-1/">basics of presentations</a> whilst driving. I will read a novel (usually science-based thrillers btw) and not want to put it down. I'll occasionally read a book like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linked-Science-Networks-Albert-Laszlo-Barabasi/dp/0738206679">Linked</a> in a similar way. <br>
<br>
What's the difference?<br>
<br>
In one word: Engagement.<br>
<br>
That engagement may come because I am in a position where I <strong>need</strong> to learn something, and will engage with anything that will help me achieve that.<br>
<br>
It may come because the particular book/article/tutorial has grabbed my attention and interest.<br>
<br>
It may come because I feel the need to argue with it.<br>
<br>
It may come because I know the people who created it and know that I will learn something useful from it.<br>
<br>
Usually something that engages me in these ways also prompts action - whether its downloading the next installment, making a change in a piece of work I'm doing, telling someone about it, or writing up my reflections here.<br>
<br>
But elearning modules on the other hand...<br>
<br>
Usually they are about something in which I have no intrinsic interest. And no matter how careful the analysis has been, or how clever the instructional design (another <a href="http://www.answers.com/bugbear&amp;r=67">bugbear</a> of mine), without that intrinsic motivation to engage it's very hard to grab my attention and keep it.<br>
<br>
One of the principle characteristics of distance learning (of which elearning is just a subset) is that the learner is in control. There is nothing to stop me switching off and doing something far more interesting and useful instead.<br>
<br>
I've said this <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2006/11/22/we_want_to_buy_a_learning_module">before</a>, but if organisations really feel that an expensive, well-designed learning resource is the right way to get a message/idea/technique/rule across, then how it is marketed is critical to engage people - so that they <strong>want</strong> to see what it's all about.<br>
<br>
Just look at virtually any new show on television. I don't really know how the budgets work out, but there is obviously a largish proportion of the total budget devoted to making sure there is a buzz, making sure people know what to expect, and know what is special about that particular show.<br>
<br>
Once the learner's started with the module, then it's over to the authors/designers to make sure they keep that attention. This is where designers really need to learn from journalists, novelists, playwrights, scriptwriters etc.<br>
<br>
It's not just about putting the message in easily palatable chunks (otherwise all books would have chapters that are only a page long). It's not just about adding "interactive" elements to relieve the tedium (or documentaries would have "Press the red button now" on every third scene).<br>
<br>
It's about telling a good story; about taking the learner on a journey that they already want to to travel with you.<br>
<br>

</div><h1>Systemic change in education - it's happening</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 1 July 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>via <a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/entries/5449685290">Graham Atwell</a>.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://education.independent.co.uk/news/article2539348.ece">Independent newspaper</a> (a UK broadsheet) has reported that Knowsley council on Mersyside is completely restructing it's secondary (post 11) education.<br>
<br>
It seems to closely mirror the systemic change that <a href="http://nlcommunities.com/communities/alannovember/archive/2007/05/08/134650.aspx">Angela McFarlane proposed in an interview with Alan November</a>. School is beginning to be more like real life.<br>
<br>
The Independent reports that Knowsley are abolishing the word "school" for secondary education - instead it will reopen the current schools as "learning centres" in 2009. These will be open for from early in the morning to late evening - and even at weekends.<br>
<br>
And it's not just the name that's changing. The curriculum will be much more personalised. Generic skills such as problem solving and thinking will be made explicit. There won't be formal classes or timetables.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see how the children and the staff react to such a radical change of roles. I'm pretty sure that some will fly with it. Learning will have a purpose; more than just a qualification. Teaching will be supportive and assessment formative. It will take the best of what is currently happening in schools and provide an environment in which that best can flourish.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure though that Knowsley will be watched closely. It's the phase change that <a href="http://internettime.com/?p=881">Jay Cross described recently</a>. Such phase changes, in a political climate that prefers the status quo, will need to prove their worth.<br>
<br>
I do hope it works. Schools and local authorities need an example to follow before they will make such changes. But without systemic change our education system will continue to be stuck in the early 20th century.</div><h1>Scaffolding - my word for today</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 1 July 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://patrickdunn.squarespace.com/occasional-rants/2007/6/29/reduce-scaffolding-and-support-never-conclude.html">Patrick Dunn</a> reminded me of the word scaffolding, in a post about <a href="http://internettime.com/">Jay Cross's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0787981699/ref=reg_hu-wl_item-added/026-0237550-9798074">Informal Learning book</a>.<br>
<br>
It was a concept I first came across when studying <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">Gilly Salmon's ideas on emoderating</a>. It's the tutor's / trainer's / teacher's job to provide enough scaffolding so that the learner doesn't collapse under the weight of new ideas, concepts or skills. But they need to learn when to remove the scaffolding so that learners can gain confidence in their learning abilities.<br>
<br>
Learning Designers (and I mean that in its widest sense - as anyone that designs learning experiences for anyone else) are very good at providing scaffolding, but we often forget to gradually remove it. We continue providing "courses" or "programmes" and wonder why we lose learners along the way.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we need to build into our designs an explicit expectation that learners will be given wings to fly - but also explicit safety nets for those that aren't quite ready yet.  </div><h1>Learning Materials and Content Management Systems</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 July 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>When I start exploring a new topic, I often look for a tutorial on the subject.<br>
<br>
Often, these might take the form of a Powerpoint, or a PDF. That's great, because I can easily print it to read offline.  The problem with putting materials in these chunked up formats is that they then become pretty inaccessible if I'm in a more "informal" mode of learning - when I want to find or link to a specific page of information.<br>
<br>
So we've tended to break apart tutorials and put them in a separate web pages, often in a content management system. This will automatically build navigation elements, links to related pages, search engine indexes etc.<br>
<br>
That's great for informal learning, but now, if I want to print a whole tutorial off I have to do each page individually.<br>
<br>
I was looking for a way of combining the best of both worlds - and I've found it. There's nothing new here. A lot of high-powered sites already have ways of displaying multiple pages in one window ready for printing. I've not found it in the low-cost / open-source CMS's until now.<br>
<br>
My current CMS of choice is <a href="http://www.etomite.org/">Etomite</a>. It stores content in a tree structure, with each page being a branch of the tree.<br>
<br>
Etomite allows designers to add "snippets" of code to perform specific jobs.<br>
<br>
So, all I did is wrote a snippet that looks at a particular part of the tree and pulls out the content from all the child pages of that branch; displaying them in a new window.<br>
<br>
Now we have the best of both worlds. Experienced learners can find and jump to specific pages very quickly. New learners can work through in sequence, or print out a whole section so they can work through offline.<br>
<br>
It's not rocket science, but it's what Content Management Systems are great for - reusing the same content in lots of different ways.<br>
<br>

She's already got <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/jaycross.html">Jay Cross</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/cliveshepherd.html">Clive Shepherd</a>, so let's hope I can come up with something different...<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/">Firefox</a></strong><br>
Number one spot has to go to Firefox. It's my window on the web. It's becoming the main place where I find information, create materials and ideas, and collaborate with other people. Since I also create a lot of web-based material it's my principal development assistant. The web-developer toolbar extension is essential to help troubleshoot tricky layouts.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a></strong><br>
If Firefox is my window on the web, Google Reader is a pair of binoculars. It's the first page I open every day. It allows me to easily keep track with current thinking, and to join in conversations. When used with sites like <a href="http://www.blogdigger.com/">Blogdigger</a>, I can discover new pockets of expertise very easily.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a></strong><br>
I know Wordpress is a very good blogging platform, but I've worked with b2evolution for a few years now and have found it incredibly stable and capable - and very well supported. It's designed, from the ground up, to offer multiple blogs to multiple individuals and groups. If people are looking for a platform to support reflective CPD I always point them here.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.etomite.org/">Etomite</a></strong><br>
Having a good, flexible content management system in your bag is an essential part of being a learning systems provider. They allow you to devolve content production, build navigation automatically, provide search capability, and reuse content in many ways across the site. For me, it was a toss-up between Etomite and <a href="http://www.exponentcms.org/">ExponentCMS</a>. Both are very good, and highly configurable. Where Etomite steals the show though is it's handling of friendly URLs and its ability to export the whole site to a static set of web-pages. Great for clients that want a large site generated quickly, but don't want to do any editing on it.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.snagit.com/">Snagit</a></strong><br>
I don't buy much software; I tend to use what's available in the open-source world. However, when there's nothing out there for free, with the same capabilities, I will spend the money. Snagit is one of those tools. It's a screen capture tool on steroids. You can very quickly capture a window (or just a portion of a screen, or a pull-down menu), resize it, annote it, add edge effects like a drop shadow or a torn edge, and save or publish it. For producing quick users guides it's essential.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.mindjet.com/">Mindmanager</a></strong><br>
Mindmanager is another one of those tools that is so well developed that I'm happy to spend money on it. Although <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">Freemind</a> comes a very close second as an open source alternative. They both allow you to create, edit and publish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping">Mind Maps</a>. Where MindManager wins is its integration with other tools like Word, Outlook and MS Project. It also comes with a number of very usable HTML templates for publishing. You can, very quickly, produce a structured information resource with dozens of pages and a coherent navigation structure.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.pspad.com/">PSPad</a></strong><br>
I do a lot of code editing (HTML, CSS, PHP mainly) and I always need a good editor that doesn't get in the way. PSPad is my current choice. It integrates with Windows Explorer nicely, highlights code well and allows me to keep whole projects together in one place.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a></strong><br>
I don't like following the crowd. So I resisted iTunes as long as possible. Until I got a Mac. Until then I'd been using a podcast catcher that sat on my mp3 player. But I'm  afraid Apple's design team won again. The whole way the software integrates with the iTunes webservice is just great. I'm still not an iPod user, so I had to get an additional (free) tool - <a href="http://www.nesfield.co.uk/synctunes/">SyncTunes</a> to pull stuff out of iTunes onto the mp3 player. I rely on podcasts alongside Google Reader to engage with the learning community. It means driving time is not wasted.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/">Google search</a></strong><br>
At risk of being boring, I really don't know how I'd do my job without a decent search engine. It's both a research and a problem-solving tool. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.kashflow.co.uk/">Kashflow</a></strong><br>
I spent a long time looking for a system to help manage the accounts for <a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/">Wyver Solutions</a>. I can learn software pretty easily usually, but every single system seemed to need an in-depth knowledge of accounting terms and practices. The crunch came when I moved to the Mac, and the tool I was using (as best of a bad bunch) would not work on it. I came across Kashflow and tried their two month free trial. It's a web-based system; with all the advantages that brings. They've got the financial backing of a former Secretary of State for Employment, Trade and Industry. I understand it. The support is great. And my accountant likes what comes out at the end. It's not free. But I wouldn't expect a high-quality, robust service to be so.<br>
<br>
So that's my top ten tools. I've missed out a lot of tools that I use on a daily basis. These are the ones I would be stuck without at the moment. Although I'm sure alternatives would come in their place.<br>

<br>
In this final year I'm focusing on my Dissertation, in which I'm doing some research to find out "the salient characteristics of those people or organisations whose websites form the hubs within a learning network".<br>
<br>
By a "learning network" I'm making a big assumption in that it will use RSS as the linking mechanism, with the nodes being the websites that produce and republish or aggregate those feeds. My personal experience has shown these types of global networks to be extremely effective at transmitting and developing ideas.<br>
<br>
My working premise is that organisations that wish to promote learning on a large scale need to become valuable nodes in these online learning networks. The research is trying to ascertain what makes such nodes valuable and what drives the people &amp; organisations behind these nodes to keep on adding value. The results will be useful to organisations across many sectors that are tasked with promoting and influencing learning &amp; development.<br>
<br>
The video below gives a brief (2 minute) introduction to what I'm trying to find out.<br>
<br>
If you watch it, and decide you wish to take part in the research, I would invite you to participate by completing the survey. It should only take about 15 minutes.<br>

My colleague, <a href="http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/">Karyn</a>, has been encouraging me to try it out. So here are my initial reactions (and they're <strong>not</strong> favourable):<br>
<br>
<h3>What is Twitter?</h3><br>
<br>
When you get a Twitter account you're presented with a box where you have 140 characters in which to say what you're doing now.<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/twitter_input.png" alt="Twitter input box" title="Twitter input box" width="578" height="185"><div class="image_legend">Twitter: What are you doing now?</div></div><br>
You can also add entries by phone or via a small number of instant messenger clients (not Skype or Microsoft IM unfortunately).<br>
<br>
You can choose whether you want your entries to be open to the world, or just to people you allow to see them.<br>
<br>
You can "follow" other people's entries. This means that they appear in your personal "timeline" - or list of entries. They can also be sent to your mobile phone as a text message.<br>
<br>
Similarly, other people can choose to follow you and your entries.<br>
<h3>What is Twitter for?</h3><br>
The main reason people seem to use Twitter is to increase their sense of connectedness to their network. <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/my-harry-potter-moments/">Will Richardson</a> has showed how he used it to rapidly get feedback from his followers (that sounds so cultish, but it's the term Twitter uses!)<br>
<h3>What do I think?</h3><br>
I've only had 24 hours exposure to Twitter, but already I'm sorely tempted to delete my account. My mobile is full of text messages from one half of a conversation - most of which I'm not interested in anyway. Like a commenter on one of <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=40924">Stephen Downes posts</a>, I would ask whether people really want to be that connected?<br>
<br>
If I could guarantee that the people I follow will always write stuff that is useful to me then perhaps I'll reconsider my opinion. Until then, I think I'll stick with blogs - where at least, most of the time, people are writing interesting stuff. I just haven't got the time to maintain Twitter connections as well.<br>
<br>
If you want to see an even more considered response, as to why Twitter and the like prevent us from doing, learning, creating, and becoming experts, see <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/httpwww37signal.html">Kathy Sierra's post</a>.<br>

Thanks in advance.</div><h1>The King is Dead – Long Live the King</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 August 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>"Content is King!"<br>
<br>
So goes the mantra of elearning development companies the world over. But what sort of content and what sort of king?<br>
<br>
For most (corporate) consumers of elearning, content means self-study modules, that sit in some sort of delivery system.<br>
<br>
In academic and formal education settings e-learning has a completely different connotation – involving collaboration, assessment, eportfolios etc – which is beginning to filter into the corporate space, but very slowly.<br>
<br>
This linear type of learning material has its origins in military training – where a behaviourist approach to learning is the most appropriate. This sort of approach often includes elements of watch, try and test. The user is expected to learn that a particular stimulus or event requires certain responses which have pre-defined by the organisation. Successful completion through the learning materials is seen as a measure of competence.<br>
<br>
That's the basis of the whole SCORM approach to learning content - linear learning objects with simple assessed tasks. Nice and simple - but even <a target="_blank" href="http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/content/20021002000737">the creators of SCORM say it's not for everyone</a>.<br>
<br>
I am not arguing for a wholesale ditching of this type of learning material. It has its place. But I am arguing for a rethink of what we mean by learning content, and in particular how we deliver and market it.<br>
<br>
<h4>Why do we use online content?</h4><br>
<br>
We put materials online for many reasons:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>It allows us to have one, central copy of the materials, which we know is always up-to-date, and allows us to devolve distribution costs such as printing to the end-user;</li><br>
<li>It allows us to make use of multi-media elements that are not available in printed format, such as animations, simulations, video and audio;</li><br>
<li>It allows us to offer hypertext navigation within the materials – and thus multiple navigation routes;</li><br>
<li>It allows users to perform searches of the materials, in order to find the ones they want, and also to search within the materials themselves to find the bit they need;</li> <br>
<li>It allows users to use the materials in ways appropriate to their needs – eg. Using their browser functions to change text size, bookmark particular sections, highlight key parts and take notes for future reference – or extracting the content to be used offline – perhaps as printed materials, or in a PDA, or a video iPod;</li><br>
<li>It allows users to connect with other people who are using the materials – perhaps creating reviews, adding ratings or making recommendations;</li><br>
<li>It allows materials to be targeted to particular users based on prior history, on stated preferences or on management requirements;</li><br>
<li>It allows users to interact with the materials, by taking the parts that are appropriate to them and reworking them into their personal knowledge-base, or by communicating and collaborating with distant colleagues or subject matter experts to implement the ideas.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Some of these reasons are about pure “content” design, others are about the delivery systems that we put into place through which users will get to the content.<br>
<br>
<h4>Redefining the monarchy</h4><br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the above set of reasons and use them as a basis of analysing a typical content module.<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Reducing distribution costs is one of the main reasons organisations choose to put materials online, yet often with little thought about how people are going to find or be told about the new materials, or of updates to those materials. Every online learning initiative should be surrounded by a communications and marketing strategy which ensures the right people see the materials at the right time. Otherwise it is just like putting a book into a library without adding its details to the index or informing the librarian.</li><br>
<li>Often online materials are simply text and graphics with any animations simply to add some visual interest. It's rare to find content that makes full use of the multi-media capabilities afforded by the online environment. This is mainly (and rightly) because, to create them with high-production values, would be beyond what most organisations would be prepared to pay. Yet, in the world of rapid/disposable elearning, it is not necessarily that expensive - as long as you accept the limititations of the rapid/disposable approach.</li><br>
<li>Most elearning modules offer very limited navigation options. Many of them are simple linear learning modules, which are fine for a particular purpose, but not useful at all for people wanting to find specific sections, pages or terms.<br><br>It's like taking a book, removing the contents page and the index, and only giving it to people one page at a time, in the order we set, at the place we dictate (at a computer screen).<br><br>At least with a book, I can work through sequentially, dip in randomly, find sections or pages of interest, and even read it in the bath. Taking the analogy further, when we give people a click-to-reveal “interaction” that's like going back to the lift-the-flap books we had when we were learning how to read...</li><br>
<li>It's very rare to see search capabilities implemented within learning packages (although <a href="http://www.articulate.com/products/presenter.php" target="_blank">Articulate Presenter</a> does this well). And it's rare to find a content delivery system that enables learners to search for packages (even if metadata has been provided as part of the SCORM manifest).<br><br>Unless learners are directed (somehow) to specific materials they are unlikely to find them. This is exacerbated by the fact that most organisations' content delivery systems are hidden away from the search tools such as Google that many learners will be using on a daily basis.</li><br>
<li>Much of the output of learning design takes away from the user the control they may expect when using online resources. For example disabling right-click, using fixed-size windows, removing the browser tool bar etc. Now there will be times when some or all of those techniques may be appropriate. But I would argue this should be the exception rather than the norm.<br><br>Printing is another issue. I can't tell you how many times I've sat with a learner working through a learning module who's asked if they can print it to read &amp; scribble on offline. It's hard to tell them that they'll have to print each page individually. That's another learner who's had the control they expect taken away from them.</li><br>
<li>Allowing users to connect with other people who are using the materials – perhaps creating reviews, adding ratings or making recommendations – is more a function of the delivery system rather than the content (unless the content is totally embedded into the delivery system pages). We do need an alternative model for learning management systems (<a target="_blank" href="http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-kind-of-lms.html">as proposed by Tony Karrer a while back</a>) I've long argued for a model based on that of the successful ecommerce providers such as Amazon, where the learning content is the product. The reviews and ratings would provide critical metadata for the learners.</li><br>
<li>Allowing materials to be targeted to particular users based on prior history, on stated preferences or on management requirements is exactly the Amazon model. It would provide a combined performance support and knowledge provision system. If combined with user generated content and a means of finding other people in the organisation with similar interests you then have an extremely powerful and effective learning marketing system – where learning can become an integral part of the organisational culture, rather than just an add-on.</li><br>
<li>Many learning materials are designed so that they cannot be disaggregated into their component parts. Yet the prevailing culture, as shown in iTunes, Youtube etc  is changing the way people think about content. They expect to be able to take the bits that are relevant to them and remix it into their own content collections. In learning content terms, this could mean enabling individual media elements to be embedded in an individual's blog or home page. Which would potentially mean disaggregating large content modules. Or providing categorised RSS feeds which enable individuals to automatically pull down new content items that fit their search or filtering criteria.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h4>Keep the learner at the centre</h4><br>
<br>
Now, I know that some of these ideas may be mutually exclusive. Keeping the learner at the centre of our thinking when designing content and configuring delivery systems will help us to decide which approach is best for that particular situation.</div><h1>Meme: Random things</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 August 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Well, this is the first time I've been tagged, and by none less than <a target="_blank" href="http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/2007/08/meme-8-random-facts-about-me.html">Karyn</a>.<br>

<br>
Amazingly, (and I am flattered), he even quoted me in a <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/link/story/0,,2170978,00.html">column he wrote for the Guardian this week</a>. In it he discusses an approach to teacher CPD that is characterised by a focus on the needs of the school &amp; the teacher. Not imposed from outside. He's talking in the context of using ICT effectively, but this approach should be true across the board.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that he notes that Building Schools for the Future has concentrated on the "stuff" - the hardware &amp; environment - and missed out the CPD angle.<br>
<br>
Interesting because Laurie O'Donnell from LTS has recently been <a href="http://ltsblogs.org.uk/laurieodonnell/?p=57#comments">comparing the Scottish education system with Singapore</a>.

If you're looking for a free open (note: not open source - just open file formats) alternative to MS Office then you now have a choice between one supported by IBM, and one supported by Sun and <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/buzzentry.jspa?selectedCategoryID=5&amp;threadID=2191&amp;tstart=0">IBM</a> (<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>).

<br>
Here's what I wanted to add to his post:<br>
<br>
Hi Stephen,<br>
<br>
Yes, perhaps "Organisational Learning" is a misnomer - but it is very definitely about how organisations can support learning. Part of that is developing a culture that is supportive &amp; expects learning. Part of that is in the performance management systems (not sure where you got "performance standards" from).<br>
<br>
I disagree totally that we should call it "managed learning". Just because it's coming from a corporate perspective doesn't mean that the corporation should manage learning. Instead the organisation should be looking at how to provide a direction for learning, and, at the same time, support the individual learning needs of the people in the organisation.</div><h1>Jason Rhode: Socially-Constructed Self-Paced Learning: VoiceThread</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 September 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've come across a few <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> based sites now that wouldn't allow comments without a login, but offered no means of registering for a password - very odd.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Jason used <a href="http://voicethread.com/">VoiceThread</a> very effectively to provide commentary on his <a href="http://www.idolresources.com/?p=460">model for socially-constructed self-paced learning</a>.<br>
<br>
I tried to post this comment on his site, but got stopped by WordPress, so here goes...<br>
<br>
Fantastic use of the VoiceThread tool. However, until they get a viable business model, I wouldn't want to use it for resources that I want to hang around for a long time. Great for meeting the immediate needs of a particular learner group though.<br>
<br>
I think your model paints a very good picture of a "modern" learning institution. The bit I see missing is how the initial connection is made to other cohorts or individuals outside of your original cohort. Is that the role of a tutor? To make the introductions? Or do you see this happening serendipitously, as in <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a>?<br>
<br>
From experience in doing an entirely online Masters, I know how hard it is to get people talking even within the cohort. Which is where <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml" target="_blank">Gilly Salmon's model</a> comes in useful. However, that's for tutor/cohort driven courses - not self-paced.</div><h1>Coaching &amp; me</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 October 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>I was at this year's <a href="http://www.skillsoft.com/">Skillsoft</a> Cafe yesterday. A fascinating day, with excellent case studies from some of their clients, and a good networking opportunity.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>One of the presentations was from <a href="http://www.greatcompaniesconsulting.com/consultant.php?pages_id=1">Judith Leary Joyce</a> who was looking at how to be an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Becoming-Employer-Choice-Organization-People/dp/1843980576">Employer of Choice</a>. Amongst a list of characteristics of inspirational managers, she suggested they work with a coaching style whenever possible.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>Judith went on to explain that this meant not answering questions directly but instead taking the time to either help the questioner work out the answer for themselves, or point them in a direction where they could find out the answer for themselves.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>She said that too many managers answer all their teams' questions thus a) becoming overloaded, and b) not developing capability &amp; capacity to learn within the team.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly. Sometimes it's just taking the easy option (for both parties) to give the answer... but in the long term that develops reliance on the manager and doesn't build the team.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>So - don't expect any quick fixes from me for the time being. Instead I'll respond with: "Now let's see how we can work this one out..."</p><br>

<br>
It's entitled "Social Networks - the future of CPD". Although rather than focus of social networks per se, I'm looking wider... at informal learning, at communities of practice, at using technology to help widen the CoPs, and at the skills required from teachers in order to effectively engage with their own CPD.<br>
<br>
I've prepared a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/presentations/Social_Networks_-_the_future_of_CPD/launcher.html">draft version of the presentation</a>, with a quick narration to go with it. You'll need speakers or headphones to hear the narration.</div><h1>The implications of encouraging self-directed learners</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 31 October 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was at the Norfolk e-safety &amp; e-learning conference yesterday, <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/10/29/social_networks_the_future_of_cpd">expounding the benefits</a> of getting teachers involved in the range of CPD networks that are out there.<br>
<br>
What we didn't go into was the implications for those teachers and their schools...<br>
<br>
Based on my own experience, this is what is likely to happen:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The teacher will develop many connections with people outside of their school - including across the world;</li><br>
  <li>The teacher will end up having more in-depth conversations about their professional practice;</li><br>
  <li>These conversations are far more likely to take place with people outside of their school than inside;</li><br>
  <li>The teacher will begin to understand that face-to-face events and meetings can be so much more effective if the people involved are part of an existing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ewenger.com/theory/">community of practice (CoP)</a>;</li><br>
  <li>The teacher will gradually give up on "traditional" conferences and training events, knowing that they can get better professional development via their CoPs;</li><br>
  <li>The teacher will encourage their students/pupils to go on similar learning journeys and build their own Communities of Practice;</li><br>
  <li>The teacher will begin to realise that the existing school structures (curriculum, assessment, timetable, buildings etc) do not fit self-directed learners and will start to look at alternative models.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
So what does a school do with that teacher?<br>

</div><h1>Harold Jarche » Industrial Schooling in Contravention of the UN</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 November 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Harold Jarche is alleging (time to be careful here over language I think...) that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jarche.com/?p=1351">New Brunswick is contravening the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>.<br>
<br>
It's a powerful statement - and one with which I have a lot of sympathy.<br>
<br>
The key point for me is:<br>
<blockquote>Children are only given the option of either attending public school or receiving no support from public funds in order to seek knowledge themselves.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Until public funds follow the child into whatever type of education they take-up we are always going to get the top-down, industrial situation we're in now. Change will never happen because innovation is stifled.<br>
<br>
If the funding followed the child, then parents could choose from a range of education methods and organisations which are currently only options for the relatively well-off - eg. home schooling, innovative small schools etc.<br>
<br>
Yes, there would still be inequity. The more well-off would still be able to buy "quality". I can't see a way around that.<br>
<br>
And there would always be the problem of the government proving that the money's been well-spent. Governments will always take a short-term view of measurement and thus measure what's easy rather than what's meaningful.<br>
<br>
And the problem with innovation is that there will be some failures - it's how we learn after all! Will a government take a risk like that? Only when society starts to take learning seriously as something each individual is responsible for.<br>
<br>
Some people will say I'm arguing for the privatisation of education... well, if that's what it takes to create an education system that meets the needs of the 21st Century then yes. Although, perhaps I would regulate the system to keep the profits inside it instead of going to shareholders...<br>
<br>
There's a lot more to think about here. But thanks Harold for stimulating the process of political change.<br>

<br>
She's looking at issues related to Education, e-Learning and the possible contributions that these areas may bring to developing countries like Brazil (her home).<br>
<br>
The thing that grabbed me in her first post was when she said "developing countries are the ones which especially need e-Learning".<br>
<br>
I agree - in some ways the developed world's existing infrastructure &amp; history of education is hindering it from adopting new methods and ideas more appropropriate to the 21st Century.</div><h1>Learning Conversations Blogroll</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 November 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Thanks to <a href="http://theobvious.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/my-blogroll-is-.html">Euan</a> I've discovered that <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> now lets you publish a list of the blogs you read in a particular folder.<br>

<br>
In words: the amount of <strong>Time you spend in dialogue</strong> is proportional to the <strong>number of people involved</strong> x the <strong>Importance of changes occuring</strong>.<br>
<br>
Let's take four examples where change is a desired outcome:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A local authority (US: District) needs to get across the opportunities and potential dangers of internet-based communication tools within schools;</li><br>
  <li>A government project is put out to tender;</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
How important is it to make sure the right changes happen, the right decisions made? Often the inputs to these processes would be (respectively):<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A day conference - with a couple of high profile keynote speakers;</li><br>
  <li>Reading long tender documents from each of the bidders;</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Over the past year, I've been involved in both of these types of change processes, and have learnt from other people's experiences.<br>
<br>
It appears that those responsible for designing the inputs are beginning to realise that dialogue is critical. <br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/300px-Ideal_feedback_model.svg.png" alt="Feedback model" title="Feedback model" width="300" height="124"><div class="image_legend">Image credit: <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback">Wikipedia</a></div></div><br>
<br>
Dialogue involves feedback. Without feedback, it's nearly impossible to ensure that your input is causing the output you're aiming for.<br>
<br>
By spending time engaging in dialogue we can be much more certain that the change we want will be "right". The manager will be the right person for the job. The bidding company (and the awarding organisation) will understand the precise requirements of the tender. The conference speaker will know where to pitch their talk, and deal with any misunderstandings. <br>
<br>
How can we build feedback into our change processes?<br>
<br>
Let's take the conference speaker... We'll assume they've been well briefed by the organisers. But let's also make sure the speaker is willing and able to engage with the <strong>delegates</strong> before &amp; after the talk. <a target="_blank" href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/trying_to_desig.html">Ewan's a great example of this</a>.<br>
<br>
What about the tender process?<br>
<br>
Often potential clients (especially those looking at something completely new), don't really know what they want. The ones that are a pleasure to work with are those who know what they don't know, and engage in an ongoing dialogue to make sure that both the client's and the provider's understanding are closely matched.<br>
<br>
In each scenario, we need to balance how much time we're prepared to spend in dialogue with the importance of getting the right result. There is no optimum balance point that will work every time. Each situation is different, and each will need a slightly different amount of dialogue &amp; feedback.<br>

</div><h1>Looking for a Learner Support System</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 December 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>For a long time I've been looking for my ideal Learner Support System. It may well exist in the guise of an "Enterprise" system - but I want one that <strong>I</strong> can understand.<br>
<br>
Here's what it needs to do:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>It needs to be as simple to install and upgrade as <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>;</li><br>
  <li>It needs to allow users to add content to it - whether HTML pages, Word docs, PDFs, <a href="http://www.exelearning.org/">Exe</a> modules, <a href="http://www.articulate.com/">Articulate</a> presentations etc;</li><br>
  <li>Each piece of content should be individually addressable;</li><br>
  <li>The metadata about each piece of content should be fully searchable;</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to find content by searching and sorting, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification">faceted classification</a>, and through automated recommendations (other people who used this also used X);</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to leave comments and ratings against each item of content;</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to link up with other users with similar interests/learning needs;</li><br>
  <li>It should be able to authenticate against other systems (again, similar to Moodle's authentication plugins;</li><br>
  <li>It should allow particular groups of users to be targetted with promotions about particular content items;</li></ol><br>
<br>
Can you see where I'm heading? I'm looking at a cross between a Content Management System (which can also handle externally-built content packages), an ecommerce system (which is delivering content, without the "buying" bit), <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a> (for the social networking), and Moodle for the back-end administration and installation.<br>
<br>
The typical organisation using it would be one that is creating a lot of content (using, say, a rapid development tool such as Articulate or <a href="http://www.atlantic-link.co.uk/home_contentpoint.htm">Atlantic Link's Content Point</a>). They will understand that the learner is in control, and needs to be persuaded, rather than told what to do.<br>
<br>
Any ideas?<br>
<br>
<br>
</div><h1>RBCs and classroom practice</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 December 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I spent some time last week with one of England's Regional Broadband Consortiums (RBC). There are ten of these "consortia of LEAs that provide internet services, broadband infrastructure and content for LEAs and schools in their regions" (from <a target="_blank" href="http://web.e2bn.net/rbcs.htm">E2BN</a>).<br>
<br>
I gave a short presentation on "How can the RBC change classroom practice". The concept map that I used as a basis for the talk is shown below.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markberthelemy/2117544241/"><img src="./assets/2117544241_3d61a17ef0.jpg" alt="Concept map" title="Click for a larger image"></a><br>
<br>
With the inputs being the RBC's purpose &amp; vision, the outputs - ie. what it does - could/should be:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Services</li>  <br>
<li>Advice &amp; Support</li><br>
<li>Funding</li>  <br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<em>Services</em><br>
<br>
I believe RBC's should be offering services at three levels: for <strong>individual teachers </strong>(to experiment &amp; to learn), for <strong>schools</strong> (to formalise what is being learnt into whole school initiatives), and for the <strong>region</strong> (to provide safe environments for region-wide initiatives.<br>
<br>
These services should comprise hosting that allows simple application installation (eg. using <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_(web_hosting)">Fantastico</a>), as well as the ability to install other script-based applications (probably using PHP).<br>
<br>
The RBC should consider providing a media-streaming service (like Youtube), which provides a safer environment for teachers to use with their learners.<br>
<br>
<em>Funding</em><br>
<br>
Alongside the services above, the RBC's are in a position to offer funding for teachers and schools to develop content, applications and ideas.<br>
<br>
<em>Advice &amp; Support</em><br>
<br>
Finally, the RBC can &amp; should be a catalyst for making connections between teachers. It should use technologies such as blogs &amp; podcasts to highlight what is being created and discussed across the region.<br>
 <br>
The key thing for me is that all of the above should be designed to stimulate a culture of:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Learning to learn</li><br>
  <li>Experimentation</li><br>
  <li>Reflection</li><br>
  <li>Creativity</li><br>
  <li>Making connections</li><br>
</ul><br>

 </div><h1>Education for a 21st Century society</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 December 2007</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There seems to be a fair bit of talk at the moment about how we should / could change our education systems to more closely match the needs of modern society.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/some-new-years-dreaming/">Will Richardson</a> is wondering whether change can only come about in our lifetimes by starting a new system from scratch. Whilst <a href="http://edtechvalley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Brumbaugh</a>, in his comments on Will's post, talks about political change from within.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://beyond-school.org/2007/12/27/on-leaving-teaching-to-become-a-teacher/" target="_blank">Clay Burrell</a> wonders whether there's a way "to leave the daily farce of gradebooks, attendance sheets, tests, corporate and statist curriculum, homework assignments, grade-licking college careerist “students” (and parents), fear of parents and administrators, and fear of inconvenient socio-political truths - and at the same time, to make a far more meaningful impact on the lives of the young?" <a href="http://professor-marvel.com/blog/2007/11/educational-system-blow-it-up-and-start.html" target="_blank">Ric Murry</a>, although seemingly tongue-in-cheek, puts forward a proposal for an International Online School of 21st Century Literacy.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.infinitethinking.org/2007/12/with-countdown-towards-end-of-2007.html" target="_blank">Lucie deLaBruere</a> has given a wonderful example of a fifth grade teacher, nearing retirement, who is constantly "looking for opportunities to engage kids in <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tmarra/authenticity/authen.html" target="_blank">authentic learning</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://g4classes.com/learningforward/?p=17" target="_blank">Kent Cheshunt</a> has examined the samba school model in Brazil, which:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Are voluntary</li><br>
<li>Allow for significant choice</li><br>
<li>Don’t allow for infinite individual choice</li><br>
<li>Provide for intergenerational interaction / teaching / learning</li><br>
<li>Provide for collaboration between novices and experts</li><br>
<li>Provide authentic tasks / learning experiences (making costumes, choreography, learning to dance, …) within a real-world context (preparing to perform in the next carnival)</li><br>
</ul><br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
I was talking to a friend today, who is currently training to be a teacher, about the impact of ICT on teaching &amp; learning. The <a href="http://publications.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=28221" target="_blank">2007 review of the research evidence by Becta</a> is less than positive about this impact:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>While the evidence does seem to support the view that there has been an impact on learning and teaching as a result of the introduction of ICT, it has not yet reached the point where it can be said to have transformed the educational process.</blockquote><br>
<br>
The report goes on to argue that this is because...<br>
<br>
<blockquote>...teachers fail to appreciate that learning and teaching through technology requires a new approach to pedagogy, to planning and preparation and to how the curriculum is perceived.... The evidence is that [day-to-day teaching practice, teacher-pupil relationships and teacher-teacher relationships] cannot and will not remain as they have traditionally been.</blockquote><br>
<br>
The problem is that we're trying to put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wine_into_Old_Wineskins" target="_blank">new wine into old wineskins</a>. Our whole education system is built on an Industrial model of society (see <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/66" target="_blank">Sir Ken Robinson's brilliant TED talk</a> for more on this) which doesn't match the current state of much of the developed world. Not only that, it's built on the idea of a closed classroom that has little direct connection with the outside world. To be honest, up till now, It's been a pretty successful model. A good teacher can get excellent results (based on existing measures) with no reference to ICT at all.<br>
<br>
Where it starts to fall down is with people like <a href="http://gwegner.edublogs.org/2007/12/22/parable-20/" target="_blank">Graham Wegner</a> who has noted that <em>"while his own learning [has taken] off at an unprecedented rate [since discovering Web2.0 aka the Live Web], he struggled to work out how to utilise these new tools and methodologies into his own classroom."</em> Once people start to use ICT to make connections outside of their organisation, a whole new world of learning opens up. And this new world struggles to fit inside the current education &amp; CPD models. It's a world that is "authentic", it's challenging, it's personalised, and it requires new ways of handling knowledge &amp; information.<br>
<br>
So, let's take Will's idea and run with it for a while. This is something I've been considering for a while... in the context of small, remote schools (eg. on the Scottish Islands) which are currently unviable. Without them the communities break-up, but they are too expensive to maintain.<br>
<br>
There are already precedents for this type of thinking. The UK's <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/ou/p3.shtml" target="_blank">Open University</a> being the main one. We need to consider, from the ground-up, what a school-level education system will look like. From the ground-up because we cannot just change one thing (add in technology for example) without considering the system as a whole.<br>
<br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3><br>
Why is education important?<br>
What are we trying to achieve?<br>
What do we believe about how people learn?<br>
What does society need from an education system?<br>
What is the role of society?<br>
What does the individual need from an education system?<br>
What is the role of the individual?<br>
<br>
<h3>Curriculum</h3><br>
What skills, knowledge &amp; behaviours do children need to be effective individuals in our society?<br>
What curriculum will meet what we believe about education?<br>
What alternative curriculum models are available? (eg. <a href="http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/educators/curriculum/elscurriculum" target="_blank">Tasmania's Essential Learnings</a>, or the <a href="http://www.rsa.org.uk/newcurriculum/" target="_blank">RSA's competence-based curriculum</a>)<br>
<br>
<h3>Assessment</h3><br>
How can/should we measure the effectiveness of our system?<br>
How can individuals demonstrate (simply) to others their successes within the system?<br>
How can we support learners' progress towards their (our?) goals?<br>
<br>
<h3>Management</h3><br>
What resources (people, places, equipment) will we need to make our philosophy reality?<br>
Where will people learn?<br>
Where will people support learning?<br>
When will people learn?<br>
When will people support learning?<br>
How will we know the support is effective?<br>
How will we know the resources we provide are effective?<br>
<br>
<h3>Administration</h3><br>
What records will we need to keep?<br>
How will we keep those records?<br>
Who will keep those records?<br>
Where will they be?<br>
How will the records be used by appropriate people?<br>
<br>
<h3>Accountability &amp; Funding</h3><br>
Who will pay for the resources required?<br>
How will they know they are getting value for money?<br>
Will it be a charity (accepting donations), a business (making a profit), or government-funded (because society thinks it's a good idea), or a mixture of all three?<br>
<br>
Once we've agreed the questions we can come up with answers that will become a new system, suitable for the 21st Century. <br>
</div><h1>Dreams of an alternative education: Philosophy</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Continuing on from last week's post: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/12/29/education_for_a_21st_century_society">Education for a 21st Century Society</a> and also responding to Clay Burrell's request for <a href="http://beyond-school.org/2008/01/01/open-thread-1-your-dreams-of-alternative-schools/">dreams of an alternative school</a>...<br>
<br>
I'm going to work under the headings I proposed last week, and put forward some answers to the questions I raised, beginning with Philosophy:<br>
<br>
I believe that learning contributes to an overall understanding of the world we live in. Without it, mistakes will be repeated and solutions will remain undiscovered.<br>
<br>
<h4>What do I believe about the individual?</h4><br>
<br>
I believe that every person is born for a purpose.<br>
I believe that every person is born to be part of a self-supporting local and worldwide community.<br>
I believe that every person is born with an unending capacity to learn.<br>
<br>
<h4>What do I believe about the process of learning?</h4><br>
<br>
I believe that learning is the process by which connections are made between concepts &amp; ideas.<br>
I believe that this learning may take place inside an individual, or as part of a network of individuals.<br>
I believe that learning is the process by which we eliminate that which does not work and identify that which does - for the moment.<br>
The process of learning observes no barriers of age, gender, race, creed and institution<br>
<br>
<h4>What do I believe about teaching?</h4><br>
The objective of a teacher is to help develop better learners.<br>
I believe that the teacher should model continuing learning - the two roles are not an either/or situation, and the role of teacher may not always be played by the same person.<br>
</div><h1>Workshop: getting to grips with WAMP</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>These notes support a workshop that I'm going to be running this month. It's designed to help participants understand how browsers, webservers, script interpreters and databases work together to produce webpages.<br>
<br>
It is designed for people who have HTML/CSS experience, but little knowledge of script-driven sites.<br>
<br>
By the end of the workshop, participants will:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Have installed <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/?lang=en">EasyPHP</a> and <a href="http://www.webyog.com/en/">SQLyog (Community Edition)</a> on their local machines, and setup a space on their Data drive for local websites;</li><br>
  <li>Be able to create a MySQL database using SQLyog;</li><br>
  <li>Be able to install "standard" PHP/MySQL applications, such as <a href="http://www.etomite.org/">Etomite</a>, <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> on their local machines;</li><br>
  <li>Know how to transfer a local site to a web-based (eg. <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> or <a href="http://www.hasweb.com/">Hasweb</a>) server, using the control panel tools available on the server.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Remember, all we're doing here is setting up test sites. These instructions should <strong>not</strong> be used for production websites, which need far more configuring to keep them secure.</blockquote><br>
<br>
<h3>The Big Picture</h3><br>
The video presentation below (very 1970's Open University I know!) provides a simplified explanation of how the different components work together to produce webpages.<br>
<br>
[blip]Berthelemy-WhereDoWebpagesComeFrom415.flv[/blip]<br>
<br>
<h3>Practicalities</h3><br>
It is possible to do this workshop entirely using a memory stick (which would make it very portable). You'd just need a number of USB sticks with either <a href="http://www.server2go-web.de/">Server2Go</a> or <a href="http://www.chsoftware.net/en/useware/wos/wos.htm">Web Server on a Stick</a> pre-installed.<br>
<br>
However, the aim is to leave people with an expandable, working system and with the skills to be able to use it. So the process of installing &amp; configuring the software is an essential part of the workshop.<br>
<br>
<h3>Getting started</h3><br>
You will need to download two pieces of software:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.easyphp.org/?lang=en">Easyphp</a> - which is a single application that contains the three components of a script-driven website: the <strong>Apache</strong> webserver, the <strong>PHP</strong> script interpreter, and the <strong>MySQL</strong> database manager.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.webyog.com/en/">Sqlyog - Community Edition</a> - a Windows graphical interface for MySQL (it saves having to use the command line to control the databases)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4>Installing &amp; configuring Easyphp</h4><br>
The EasyPHP installer will set itself up in your Program Files folder. It will create a www sub-folder which will be where your webpages are served from. It will also create a mysql/data folder where the data for MySQL is stored.<br>
<br>
This is not ideal. It's far better to have your data &amp; your script files served from within your My Documents space (which hopefully is on a different partition to your Windows Operating System!). That way it's far easier to keep it backed up. It also means that your Program Files folder doesn't become bloated.<br>
<br>
There are two configuration files to change. Run EasyPHP, so that you see the <img src="./assets/easyphp.png" alt="EasyPHP icon" title="EasyPHP icon" width="15" height="20"> with the red dot flashing in your task bar.<br>
<br>
Right click on the icon and select "Configuration".<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/easyphp_configuration.png" alt="EasyPHP configuration menu" title="EasyPHP configuration menu" width="285" height="186"><div class="image_legend">These configuration options allow you to control Apache, PHP and MySQL.</div></div><br>
<br>
<h4>Configuring MySQL</h4><br>
Open the MySQL configuration file (it will open it up in your text editor), and change the line which says:<br>
<blockquote><code>datadir=${path}/mysql/data</code></blockquote><br>
to...<br>
<blockquote><code>datadir=[path_to_data_directory]</code></blockquote><br>
<br>
where the [path_to_data_directory] must be an absolute reference (ie. not relative to your current position in the file structure), and the new data folder <strong>must</strong> already exist. This is where your data will be stored.<br>
<br>
<h4>Configuring Apache</h4><br>
Then you need to do a similar thing to Apache, the webserver, to tell it where to find your websites.<br>
<br>
I simply have a folder in My Documents called <em>"websites"</em>. Then each website is contained within a separate sub-folder. Your browser will then get to the site by using the address: <em>"http://localhost/[sub-folder]"</em><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Note: you may need to change settings in your browser if you are using a proxy server - so that it ignores the proxy server for local addresses.</blockquote><br>
<br>
To change where localhost gets its webpages from, go to the EasyPHP configuration menus and choose Apache.<br>
<br>
Find the line that starts <em>DocumentRoot</em> and change the text in quotes to the path of the folder where your websites will be stored. Mine now says:<br>
<blockquote><code>DocumentRoot "E:/websites"</code></blockquote><br>
<br>
<h4>The moment of truth</h4><br>
To test that everything is working:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Create a new text file called phpinfo.php</li><br>
  <li>Copy &amp; paste the following code into that file: <code><!--?php phpinfo() ?--></code></li><br>
  <li>Save the file into your websites folder</li><br>
  <li>Open the address <em>http://localhost/phpinfo.php</em> in your browser</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
You should see something like the following:<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/phpinfo_screenshot.png" alt="PHPinfo screenshot" title="PHPinfo screenshot" width="630" height="474"><div class="image_legend">PHPinfo screenshot</div></div><br>
<br>
If you don't it's probably because I've forgotten a particular instruction. Let me know &amp; I'll see what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
<h3>Installing web applications</h3><br>
That's the hard bit over. The easy bit is setting up the applications you want to work with.<br>
<br>
There are a few common stages for every application:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Copy the applications files into your websites folder</li><br>
  <li>Create a database for it to use</li><br>
  <li>Run the installation file (if it's a nicely designed application it will have one) where you will tell the application where the database is, the database name, and the database user</li><br>
  <li>The application would then ideally create a configuration file containing all that information</li><br>

<br>
Curriculum, for me, means what skills, knowledge &amp; behaviours do learners need to develop as a result of our learning intervention.<br>
<br>
Just to keep things manageable, we need some way of organising/categorising the curriculum. In the past this has predominantly been centred on subjects - discrete areas of knowledge, driven by the subjects studied at universities. However, this subject-based framework is becoming an anachronism that simply exists because it "always" has done. It has little or no meaning outside of the formal education system, and even universities are taking a more holistic, cross-discipline approach.<br>
<br>
Tasmania's research-based <a href="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/references.htm#ELsresources" target="_blank">Essential Learnings</a> provide a potentially coherent &amp; holistic framework for a modern education system. Their five curriculum headings have much more relevance to living in today's society:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Thinking</li><br>
  <li>Communicating</li><br>
  <li>Personal Futures</li><br>
  <li>Social Responsibility</li><br>
  <li>World Futures</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
My understanding of the Tasmanian curriculum is that it is not content and knowledge-based. Instead the content used to support the learning outcomes is decided locally.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/ELsresources/essentiallearnings1.pdf">Essential Learning framework 1 document</a> is a superbly reasoned argument for their approach to the curriculum. Each heading has the following description, along with more detail than I can include here:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><h3>Thinking</h3><br>
The ability of individuals to think flexibly and creatively and to manage their learning throughout life is increasingly vital to personal success and effective communities.<br>
<br>
Thinking clearly and compassionately is prerequisite to fulfilling a role as an active and concerned citizen and to following personal pursuits successfully. Workplace requirements and career paths are likely to change frequently over a lifetime and the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and make informed choices and decisions will be of paramount importance.<br>
<br>
The transmission of information is rapidly increasing in volume and pace. This demands a capacity to think quickly and clearly about options and opinions in order to evaluate their veracity, applicability and consequences. <br>
<br>
Higher-order thinking is increasingly essential in dealing with the complex problems facing individuals and organisations. Ethical, altruistic and long-range thinking are crucial to the future of society.<br>
<br>
<h3>Communicating</h3><br>
The ability to use a range of symbols to create, express and communicate meaning is essential to learning and to living productively in a complex world. Facility with language and symbolic systems provides the means to relate effectively with others, to select and evaluate personal and life options, and to plan, adapt and enact purposeful futures with openness to learning throughout life.<br>
<br>
In an era of global communications, having creative and flexible communicative competence is fundamental to our personal, recreational and vocational opportunities.<br>
<br>
Increasingly, the capacity to interact critically with communications created and presented by others is crucial to making reasoned and informed choices and decisions. Being able to articulate our point of view thoughtfully and persuasively is essential to full participation in social and civic life as members of a democratic community.<br>
<br>
<h3>Personal Futures</h3><br>
Young people need to be provided with educational experiences that will enable them to deal successfully with current and future change with optimism and resilience.<br>
<br>
Our economic and social systems are changing. Support structures that formerly provided individuals with a sense of identity and direction, such as relatively stable families, traditional membership of religious organisations and security of work, are also changing.<br>
<br>
Technology is advancing at an accelerating pace. Ethical dilemmas abound in the modern world and learners increasingly need to examine value positions implicit in issues, think critically about all perspectives to determine their own position, deal with current challenges, and contribute to preferred futures for themselves and their community.<br>
<br>
<h3>Social Responsibility</h3><br>
In a fluid and complex global community faced with challenging choices and decisions that will affect the future of humanity and of the planet, it is imperative that we are prepared to participate actively, creatively, optimistically and responsibly as citizens in democratic communities.<br>
<br>
<h3>World Futures</h3><br>
The future of the world depends on our having the understandings, dispositions and skills to make responsible decisions to achieve a balance between acting for human benefit and sustaining ecological systems. A sense of connection with the natural world helps us to act thoughtfully and with sensitivity and care.<br>
<br>
Scientific and technological innovation is wide-ranging and occurring at a rapid pace. While this offers opportunities to participate in a new age of design and development, with the potential to enhance quality of life, these innovations must be evaluated in terms of personal, social and environmental impact and values.<br>

</blockquote></div><h1>Dreams of an alternative education: Assessment</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This is part 4  of a series of posts about an alternative education system.<br>
<br>
Assessment has many purposes. It is used to help point the way forward for individual learners. It is used to provide a simple means of judging an individual's performance and capability for future challenges. And it's used as a blunt instrument to compare the performance of different educational institutions.<br>
<br>
All of these are valid. But the measure of the institution's performance (and thus the driver of future funding) often drives the priorities for the individual. So we may find a school measured on English, Maths &amp; Science results will focus heavily on these aspects, regardless of the individual's capabilities in Music, Art or Languages.<br>
<br>
With a holistic curriculum that is more closely aligned to today's society, and assessment looking at the <strong>all aspects</strong> of that curriculum we ought to be able to minimise the impact of assessing particular aspects.<br>
<br>
We'll still need (well society will say we will) some easily digestible measure of both school and individual performance.<br>
<br>
A combination of internally-moderated teacher assessment (against clear criteria), ratified through the use of external moderators, appears the best option. We do need to move away from the current, politically-driven centralised testing &amp; marking systems. Whatever system we choose needs to be seen to be open, fair and free from bias.<br>
<br>
Assessment is, in some ways the hardest part of developing an alternative education system. It is the main means by which the system interfaces with the rest of society. So it needs to be able to be understood &amp; trusted by society. Yet, at the same time, it needs to be granular and holistic enough to be useful to the individual.<br>

</div><h1>Free network-based content filtering</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>My children are starting, occasionally, to explore websites wider than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/">CBBC</a> and <a href="http://www.tvokids.com/">TVOKids</a>... I've been wondering about some sort of filtering which would protect them from the worst excesses of the internet, would be easy to administer, and would allow us to add other computers to the network without having to set up filtering on every machine individually.<br>
<br>
I came across <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> today which appears to do all of this and more:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>They keep a central list of blocked sites;</li><br>
  <li>I can add to that list for all or some of the networks I control;</li><br>
  <li>I can whitelist sites that I want to override;</li><br>
  <li>I can set the types of materials (including phishing sites) I want blocked;</li><br>
  <li>I can create shortcut addresses to specific URLs;</li><br>
  <li>It will automatically correct common typing errors (and I can add to that list);</li><br>
  <li>There's also a nice, graphical stats display, showing what's been blocked.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
I can even partially customise the pages that come up when a page is blocked - with text &amp; a logo.<br>
<br>
And it's free... They get their income from the sponsored links that come up if someone types in a URL that doesn't resolve to a known address.<br>
<br>
All it took was to reset the DNS servers on my router, and to renew the DHCP lease on the machines on my home network (not as hard as it sounds!)<br>
<br>
I can now rest a little bit easier... although I'll still be working with my kids to help them become internet-savvy. A filter is only part of the solution.<br>
</div><h1>More bang for your buck</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 4 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Do you want to make your learning &amp; development budget go further?<br>
<br>
Do you want your training interventions have more lasting impact?<br>
<br>
Do you want to get better service from your training providers?<br>
<br>
Do you want to maximise the creative potential in your staff?<br>
<br>
If so, then you need to invest in helping your staff learn to learn.<br>
<br>
A "learning to learn" initiative will give your staff the skills to:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>make informed decisions about how, when &amp; where they learn;</li><br>
  <li>reflect on their own learning, and on their learning needs;</li><br>
  <li>develop communities of practice within your organisation (and with other people around the world);</li><br>
  <li>Keep up-to-date with rapidly changing ideas;</li><br>
  <li>Mentor and coach other team members;</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
For such an initiative to work requires commitment from the whole team. It will change the way the L&amp;D department commissions training. It will change the way managers manage. It will change attitudes to learning, and make your staff more discerning learning consumers.<br>
<br>
There are three components to a "learning to learn" initiative:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/Learning_to_Learn.jpg" alt="Learning to Learn components" title="Learning to Learn components" width="500" height="171"><div class="image_legend">Learning to Learn components</div></div><br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Changing culture - so that "what did you learn today?" becomes an accepted question across your organisation;</li><br>
  <li>Changing communication structures - so that communities of practice can develop without barriers of hierarchy or competition;</li><br>
  <li>Changing infrastructures - using simple tools to allow knowledge to flow freely in and through your organisation.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Learning to learn cannot be achieved by a single workshop or conference, although these may be useful parts. Instead it needs to be a holistic approach that incorporates:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>a clear, ongoing "marketing" campaign which sets the vision and the benefits;</li><br>
  <li>Coaching for managers at all levels;</li><br>
  <li>Guidance &amp; advice to help staff take control of their learning;</li><br>
  <li>Access to simple tools which staff can use to develop <a href="http://www.jarche.com/?p=1408">Personal Knowledge Management systems;</a></li><br>
  <li>Support for the L&amp;D department and senior managers to help them understand the implications.</li><br>
</ul><br>

</div><h1>See you at BETT</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'm off to <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">BETT</a> on Friday afternoon. This is probably one of the biggest educational (K-12) technology shows in the world. The main reason I'm going is the TeachMeet ( http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/TeachMeet08_London ) at 5pm, which adopts a model successfully used in Scotland. Participants sign up to do 7 minute presentations or 2 minute micro-presentations about a particularly aspect of technology-supported learning.<br>
<br>
Normally, when you go to conferences you look at the list of delegates and, maybe, recognise one or two names. With the TeachMeet, because many of the people involved are active bloggers, it feels like I already know half the participants. People I'm looking forward to meeting (face-to-face) for the first time include:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://islayian.blogspot.com/">Ian Stuart</a><br>
<a href="http://teaching.mrbelshaw.co.uk/">Doug Belshaw</a><br>
<a href="http://ddraig-goch.blogspot.com/">Paul Harrington</a><br>
<a href="http://digitalmavericks.blogspot.com/">Drew Buddie</a><br>
<br>
It's difficult to say exactly why I'm going to BETT this year. I haven't "taught" for over seven years now. Yet my work is hugely influenced by what I see happening in schools, and sometimes I even have the privilege of being able to influence how schools are supported. Effective CPD, that really changes the way schools &amp; teachers work, has, for a long time, been a passion of mine. Central to that is understanding the demands on teachers and the opportunities available to them.<br>
<br>
One of the key developments I see happening this year is a change in the content market. The Elearning Credits (ELC) scheme is stopping this year. So this artificially stimulated market (which has resulted in vast amounts of unused software in schools) will find itself struggling.<br>
<br>
I have been talking with <a href="http://www.ezekiels.co.uk/">Eylan Ezekiel</a> (and many others) for a while now about how learning content needs an Amazon-type environment. A marketplace for content producers. A place where anyone who produces content (from individuals to large companies, perhaps even Government quangos?) can place content for sale, or for free download. But critical to its effectiveness will be the things that Amazon does so well: incorporating user feedback, providing recommendations of other possible items, keeping in touch with customers, and offering ways of off-site promoting (or even selling) items through APIs and webpage widgets.<br>
<br>
Eylan is now working for <a href="http://blog.odeworld.co.uk/">ODE</a>, which appears to be doing exactly this. So I'm hoping to get a glimpse at what they're proposing. ODE is incubated by Pearsons, but are being given the freedom to work with other content providers. Pearsons seem to have recognised that (in an Ebay/Amazon/Google/Facebook world), the money is in the platform rather than in the content. Making sure that platform continually develops to meet the needs of the market will keep people using it.<br>
<br>
The other thing I'm looking forward to is getting my hands on an <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/">Asus eeepc</a> (aka an <a href="http://www.rm.com/Primary/Products/product.asp?cref=PD1030046">RM Minibook</a>). From what I'm seeing, everyone who has used one has this strange urge come upon them to buy it at the earliest opportunity. So, I'm off to do some action research to see if the same happens to me! Although I think my results might be already skewed...<br>
<br>
See you at BETT.</div><h1>Update to top 10 tools</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've just updated <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/markberthelemy.html">my list of Top Ten Tools</a> for <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/index.html">Jane Hart's Centre for Learning &amp; Performance Technologies</a>.<br>
<br>
It was an interesting exercise, just to see how my work has changed over the past 6 months. The list is now focussed on "learning" tools, rather than any tool that I use for work - so <a href="http://www.kashflow.co.uk/">Kashflow</a> is out.<br>
<br>
The CMS has changed, and so has the screen capture tool. Not because there's anything wrong with the others, but because Joomla &amp; Jing are a better fit for what I currently do.<br>
<br>
I've also moved away from MindManager for the moment, to using CmapTools more. Mainly because I find it fits my thought processes better.<br>
<br>
So, here's the full current list:<br>
<br>
<ol><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/firefox.html">Firefox</a>. (Open source).&nbsp; This remains at the top spot. In fact, it's such a central part of my daily learning (both consuming and creating) that I almost put it at the same level as my broadband connection - essential. What's special about it over other browsers? It was the first tabbed browser I used, which completely changed the way I use the web. It's got hundreds of add-ons, including the indispensible web-developer toolbar, Colorzilla (for easily matching colours), Scrapbook (for quickly taking snapshots of webpages for annotating later)&nbsp;and QuickProxy (which, with one click, lets you switch your proxy server on &amp; off).</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/jing.html">Jing</a>. (Closed source, but free).I'm finding I'm using this more and more. It's similar to Wink, Captivate and Snagit. However, where these are great for producing finished, polished products, Jing just sits there for when it's needed and works quickly. It's ideal for producing "disposable learning objects" (not my term, but it's starting to appear more frequently). If I need to show someone how a software function works, I capture it (either as a single image or a movie - with narration, then can choose whether to publish it to TechSmith's Screencast.com site, to my own ftp site, or to a file. It's simple. It's easy to use. And my clients think it's great.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/google.html">Google Web Search</a>. (Free to use). I know other search engines are available. But I can work Google. I know how to make it produce meaningful results. 95% of the time it does what I need. So why change? Without search, the wealth of information on the web would be like a library with no index: impossible to use effectively. With it, I know that I can learn&nbsp;almost&nbsp;anything <strong>when I need to</strong>.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googledesktop.html">Google Desktop Search</a>. (Closed source, but free).&nbsp; Just as I rely on Google web search almost more than my bookmarks, I rely on their desktop search engine to be able to find files and emails rather than wade through layers of folders. It's not infallible - being particularly frustrating when it displays part of an email, but then Outlook can't open it because it's been moved. But this is more than mitigated by the number of times its found a document that I couldn't see anywhere in my file structure.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/moodle.html">Moodle</a>. (Open source).I've been working with Moodle for four years - since version 1 came out. Although designed to work within a formal education setting, its beauty is in its flexibility. Every organisation, and every person, will use Moodle in a different way. It's would be a particularly mature learning organisation which uses every function of Moodle. Now that we've cracked the way the Moodle theme packs work, we're finding more and more applications for it - particularly in public sector organisations. There are two things that Moodle does not do well. One is handling bookings for face-to-face events, so some sort of Learner records system is an essential component of a complete solution. The other is handling content for use outside of a formal "course"-based delivery. See 6.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/joomla.html">Joomla</a>. (Open source). &nbsp; Any organisation that wishes to support learners at their point of need, as well as during formal "courses" needs an effective content management system. It needs to be searchable. It needs to allow administrators (and even users) to add content easily. And it needs to be flexible in terms of appearance and navigation. There are many content management systems out there. The commercial ones are tending&nbsp;to aim at high-end usage; with multi-format publishing, workflows, faceted search etc. For many applications, the range of open source solutions is more than adequate. Each one has its particular strengths; some have highly comprehensive configuration interfaces, some are better for bespoking, some provide immediately usable out-of-the-box solutions. But I had to choose one for this list. Joomla appears to have a strong development team. The modules available, both in the standard package, and as add-ons, are incredibly powerful. It does require careful configuration, and good support, as a complex site can become complex to change. At the moment, though, this is tending to be top of my list for content management.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/articulate.html">Articulate Engage</a>. (Commercial).&nbsp; &nbsp;Along with its big brother, Articulate Presenter, Engage is rapidly becoming a key part of my content development strategy. With Engage, I can quickly produce good-looking Flash-based materials with embedded media navigated using one of a set of pre-defined interfaces. These interfaces include (among others)&nbsp;a timeline, concentric rings, image hotspots, pyramids with layers and FAQs. Yes, you are limited to the interfaces available. But they pretty much cover most situations. I use Engage when I need to deliver something that looks good and&nbsp;covers a small amount of content. As a component part of a content strategy it's ideal.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googlereader.html">Google Reader</a>. (Free to use). Keeping up-to-date is a rapidly changing field, and knowing what the market is saying about learning, about technology, and about us is critical for success. An RSS reader allows me to do that without having to go to dozens of websites to see if they've got anything new. Google Reader has been my reader of choice for a year now. I can use it from any internet-connected browser. I can organise things just how I want. I can even share particular items, or whole groups of items, with other people in many different ways. I like the way it allows me to choose how I use it - its flexibility.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/b2evolution.html">b2evolution</a>. (Open source). I use my blog to reflect on what I'm learning, to add to the conversation about particular topics, and to store ideas and materials that I want to remember. It's an essential part of my personal knowledge management system. I chose to host it on my own webspace as then I control the data within it. It's too important to be left to a free service. And I don't need to pay someone to host it. I chose b2evolution for its flexibility. It's a multi-user, multi-blog system. Very similar to WordpressMU but far easier to install and configure.</li><li><a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/cmap.html">CmapTools</a>. (Free to certain groups). When I've got some complex ideas to sort out and simplify, I quite often turn to CmapTools. This is a concept mapping tool that allows any concept to link to any other concept, along with linking phrases. Very quickly, a map can become too complex. But then that forces a thought process to simplify it down to its essentials. I often go through that process when preparing presentations or learning materials. It makes sure you only include detail that is relevant</li></ol></div><h1>THE DOMINIE'S CHRONICLE</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 January 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://dominieschronicle.blogspot.com/">http://dominieschronicle.blogspot.com/</a></p>Via <a href="http://edubuzz.org/blogs/donsblog/2008/01/11/the-dominies-chronicle/">Don Ledingham</a>.<br>

</div><h1>Features &amp; Benefits of online learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 March 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><em>Note: I'm only looking here at one specific context - adult professional development within an organisation. These are high-level messages aimed at senior management.</em><br>
<br>
As with any learning strategy, the solution adopted should match the problem being solved. Different problems may require different solutions. The online environment is an addition to the learning professional's toolkit, which may already include elements such as face-to-face training, books, coaching sessions, mentoring programmes etc. Introducing online learning provides the following benefits:<br>
	<ul><br>
<li>It enables easier version control of materials, since there is always only one, central copy of materials to be used;</li><br>
<li>It enables workshop facilitators to focus on embedding, reinforcing and practising ideas, rather than 'delivering' content;</li><br>
<li>It gives learners control over what, how and when they learn;</li><br>
<li>It provides management tools that may help evaluation of learning materials and activities.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
To achieve these benefits using the online environment is as much of an art as in getting the best out of the face-to-face environment. However there are some general guidelines that we have found work well in professional development contexts:<br>
<br>
	<ul><br>
  <li>Ensure that you don't lose the benefits to the learner by removing control from them - in terms of what, how and when they learn. Minimise the barriers to participation or your online learning initiative will fail.</li><br>
  <li>Learning is not about delivering content - it is about people engaging with that content and doing something with it, such as discussing it, practising the ideas, taking a test, re-presenting the ideas etc. Some of this can be done online; some is best done face-to-face.</li><br>
  <li>Ensure your learners' expectations are set appropriately from the start - with clear marketing and joining instructions; </li><br>
  <li>Use the management tools carefully - the things that are easy to measure often provide meaningless information (eg. data that tells you that someone has viewed a particular page in their browser does not tell you they've learnt anything). </li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
I know there's a lot of detail missed out here. But what other high-level messages would you want to give to an organisation considering online learning?</div><h1>Moodle running on an Asus eeepc</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 11 March 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I bought one of the new Asus eeepc's last week.<br>

One of the things I really want to do with the eeepc is use it as a platform to demonstrate how <a target="_blank" href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> works. The machine has got a VGA socket, so can be plugged into a projector. It also runs Linux, which is perfect for running web applications.<br>
<br>
I followed <a href="http://www.greenhughes.com/content/installing-moodle-asus-eee-pc">Liam Green-Hughes' instructions</a> to the letter. It took about an hour of concentration. It helped that I knew a bit about how the Linux file system works anyway. This isn't a job for an absolute beginner.<br>
<br>
But, eventually, with no real hiccups, I ended up with a full blown Moodle 1.9 site running off the eeepc!<br>
<br>

<br>
I think it's because, over the past eight years, ever since I left the teaching profession, I've learnt how to learn independently.<br>
<br>
The organisation I work for, although it encourages formal learning &amp; training, also gives people the freedom to see where they want to go and to learn how to get there. There are very few restrictions (if you're sensible!) on what we can access on the internet. We are trusted to spend our time wisely (as long as the job gets done), and, in my role, allowed to choose where we work. This philosophy of trust and devolved responsibility is endemic throughout the company; financial management decisions are pushed down as far as possible, as are personnel/human resources processes (such as recruitment, absence management etc). Of course, such a level of responsibility is not left unchecked or unsupported. Strong accountability is built in at all levels.<br>
<br>
The key thing, from a learning perpective, is the underlying expectation - you will go and learn what you need to learn to meet your personal, team and organisational needs. When I was teaching, that expectation (in my eyes at least) was turned on its head. I tended used a lack of "training" as an excuse. From my perspective at that time, it was the school's responsibility to give me that training. Now, I see that it is my responsibility to be aware of what learning I need and to find it, when I need it.<br>
<br>
My personal feeling is that if we put up barriers that say to adults "you're not ready for this yet, so you can't come in", we take away that level of responsibility that lets people make choices. Yes, we should guide people to help them make good choices, but is it a bad thing if they access some materials or join a forum, that are too "difficult" for them?</div><h1>When to use rapid elearning - the Powerpoint legacy</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 May 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><blockquote>"If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail." <a href="http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Maslows_Hammer.asp">Abraham Maslow</a></blockquote><br>
With the growth in rapid elearning tools like <a href="http://www.articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/">Captivate</a> (UPDATE: And Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/resources/breeze/presenter/">Breeze Presenter</a>), and Atlantic Link's <a href="http://www.atlantic-link.co.uk/contentpoint.htm">ContentPoint</a> it means that anyone who can use Powerpoint can create materials more suitable for online delivery.<br>
<br>
Since the launch of Powerpoint, it (and tools like it, eg. <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html">OpenOffice Impress</a>) has been used to create the default backdrop for anyone standing up and speaking. Sometimes it is used particularly well, complementing the speaker's words so that, together they make a far more engaging and memorable experience. (See <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a> for some superb examples)<br>
<br>
Too often, though, presentation tools like Powerpoint are used completely inappropriately. Examples abound of text-filled slides, distracting animations, and speakers that read out the words on the slides.<br>
<br>
The next stage in the presentation tool's development was to use it independently of the speaker - as an authoring tool for standalone documents. There are great examples, like this one on <a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/?p=215">Action Mapping from Cathy Moore</a>.<br>
<br>
But, again, there are untold numbers of people being subjected to slide-based documents that should never have been put in that format. See, for example, <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/05/hillary-campaig.html">Hilary Clinton's recent "docupoint"</a> as described at Presentation Zen.<br>
<br>
Now that we've realised that Powerpoint has limitations when you use it online (for one thing that vast file sizes that you have to handle), we're moving to "rapid elearning". Which basically means converting slide-based materials into Flash and adding some nifty navigation and additional media elements.<br>
<br>
Computer geeks have, for a long time, known that if you put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Garbage In you get Garbage Out (GIGO)</a>. The same is true for rapid elearning. A Powerpoint containing pages of bullet points will never become a good elearning package (ie. engaging and memorable) without a complete rethink from the learner's perspective. Just as it was never a good idea to send it to someone as a Powerpoint expecting them to work their way through it. Just as it was probably the Powerpoint, combined with the speaker reading out each bullet point, that sent people to sleep in the meeting.<br>
<br>
So when and how should we use rapid elearning tools?<br>
<br>
There's no absolute answer to that... It's more a case of making sure rapid elearning is just <strong>one</strong> of the tools in your toolbox, and you follow two simple principles:<br>
<br>
<h3>Start with the learner - what do we need them to be able to do?</h3><br>
Consider whether they need learning activity or marketing activity? Learning &amp; marketing overlap in many ways, as both are designed to affect a change in behaviour. In many cases, good learning involves marketing, and good marketing involves learning. The distinction that I would propose (for now) is that marketing is about provoking a response through simple, high-level messages. Whereas learning is about changing behaviour through more detailed understanding. I'm up for debate on this one!<br>
<br>
<h3>How detailed does the message need to be at this stage?</h3><br>
Create materials that are appropriate for the level of detail. The table below may help:<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr valign="top">
<th>Level of details</th>
<th>Type of material</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Main message: what is the key thought you want people to have in their heads?</td>
<td>Poster, 30 second audio-visual trailer, news headline, slogan, advert</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Features and benefits: What's in it for the learner?</td>
<td>One page briefing document, 5 minute narrated presentation, comic-strip style presentation, 2 minute audio download</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Detailed information: How can I find out more? (The key thing to remember here is: how will learner want to use this information? As a quick access reference point or as something to read/watch/listen to in one go?)</td>
<td>30 minute narrated presentation from an expert, 20 minute audio interview, 5 page white-paper, website with chunked up content (which may include small chunks created in a rapid elearning tool).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
There are no right answers, and no strict demarcation lines. But if you always keep a balance between the needs of the learner and your objectives, using the right tool for the job, then you're heading in a good direction.<br>
<br>
Of course, I've not even touched on learning-specific stuff here like assessment (whether for the learner's benefit or the organisation's), or interaction with experts and peers. That's maybe for another post...</div><h1>Eon smart meter and my wireless network</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 May 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>We've had one of Eon's new smart meters installed today. It means our energy suppliers can take meter readings remotely, and also they provide a power display so we can see how much energy we're using.<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/Smartmetertitle.jpg" alt="Smart meter image" title="" width="296" height="80"><p>From <a href="http://www.eonenergy.com/At-Home/ExistingCustomers/smart-meters.htm">Eon</a></p></div><br>
The only problem is, as soon as the meter was switched back on my wireless network went haywire. Under Mac OS X the connection dropped to a crawl. Under Windows XP the connection just kept dropping out.<br>
<br>
I tried all the usual tricks - reboot everything. Then reboot again.<br>
<br>
The thing that clinched it was when I noticed a new connection in my list of preferred wireless networks. It was called <strong>2Wire64</strong>.<br>
<br>
Of course! The smart meter must be using some sort of wireless network to communicate. (Well that's what it seemed anyway)<br>
<br>
I removed that connection and changed the channel setting on my wireless adapter to channel 7 (it had been at Auto). And, as if by magic, everything started working again.<br>
<br>
Let's hope it lasts.</div><h1>Departmental roles in the Learning Organisation</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 June 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Where does learning sit in your organisation?<br>

<br>
There are good arguments for all of these.<br>
<br>
What's your experience?</div><h1>Criticism, product development and self-censorship</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 June 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>How do you respond to criticism? Me? My immediate response is normally to go off in a huff - but I'm working on that!<br>
<br>
Let's say you're creating a product for some people to use, and one of that group says it's difficult to use, how would you respond?<br>
<br>
If it was me, I would try to engage with that person to find out why they find it difficult and then make the decision whether to change the product.<br>
<br>
What happens if that person reviews your product in public? For example, in a web forum, or on a personal website?<br>
<br>
A company that understands the dynamics of the web would probably respond to the criticism. They'd engage with the community, but especially with that individual. By bringing on board someone who has been critical they are more likely to win converts.<br>
<br>
A company that doesn't understand the web may decide to request that the offending article be removed. This is despite the fact that it will still exist in the Google cache. And despite the fact that they have no legal right to request that personal opinion be removed. Just imagine what would happen if theatres or restaurants could effectively censor newspaper critics!<br>
<br>
Yet this is exactly what has happened to <a href="http://www.dougbelshaw.com/2008/06/17/censorship-and-the-personalprofessional-divide/" target="_blank">Doug Belshaw</a>. Following an article (on his personal website) in which he commented on a number of online learning environments for schools, one of the companies mentioned (TALMOS) threatened legal proceedings on him via his school if he didn't remove an offending paragraph.<br>
<br>
Doug complied with this request due to the difficult situation it put him under at work.<br>
<br>
There's a disclaimer on my blog that states that it's totally independent of any professional relationship that I have. Yet, even so, I am very careful to ensure that my writing does not cause embarrassment or give away confidential information. That's just sensible self-censorship.<br>
<br>
I can't blame Doug for removing the offending words. In fact, by doing so he's probably highlighted how little the company concerned understands the web. But I am surprised that his school couldn't see the parallels between writing reviews of teaching materials (in, for example, the TES) and writing similar reviews on a personal website. I wonder how it might have caused embarrassment to the school? Is there anything that could have predicted that response?</div><h1>Earthquake elearning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 June 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Tom Kuhlmann, in his always useful <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning">Rapid Elearning Blog</a> writes <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/3-simple-steps-to-create-background-images-for-your-next-e-learning-scenario/">today</a>:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Where I live, the threat of earthquakes is real so we were required to have a 72-hour emergency pack at our desks.  Needless to say not many of us did.  However, we always passed the online safety courses that required we have 72-hour packs.</blockquote><br>
<br>
How similar that is to the current trend for online compliance training. It begs the question, why spend the money on creating the training if it doesn't have any significant impact on behaviour? Is it really just a box-ticking exercise?<br>
<br>
Tom goes on to describe how scenarios - stories that illustrate the consequences of behaving in particular ways - can provide the psychological impetus to change.<br>
<br>
The challenge then is to persuade your client that this format will actually work better than the "traditional" bullet-pointed instructional elearning module.<br>
<br>
The scenario also requires far more work from the client to come up with the background information, the stories, that can be used as its basis.<br>
<br>
But if they want it to actually work...</div><h1>Training - it's what you do to a dog</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 July 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>For a while I've been wondering about the words we use to describe our profession. Like <a href="http://www.trainingzone.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=185067&amp;d=1">Donald Taylor</a>, I'm not convinced that learning &amp; development really can be considered a profession until we have a clear set of standards by which we can measure ourselves. Part of that includes tightening up on our language.<br>
<br>
My dog is three years old. By now she's learnt where she can relieve herself and the bits of the house she's not allowed in. She occasionally walks to heel and, even more occasionally, comes back when I call her name. Why does she do that? Because she's associated particular behaviour with either reward or punishment. We call that "training".<br>
<br>
I know very little about tennis, but, to my untutored eyes, Andy Murray has become a considerably better tennis player over the past year. How has he done that? Through considerable work, with his coach, to make his body react faster and his muscles stronger. We call that "training".<br>
<br>
A few years back I became the manager of a small team. All new managers had to learn about the company's appraisal processes. I spent one day with a group of other managers and an expert in appraisal. By the end of that day I was allowed to perform appraisals. We call that "training".<br>
<br>
What are the similarities here?<br>
<br>
For each scenario there is an expected outcome - a particular behaviour or characteristic that is required. In the case of the dog it's keeping to her part of the house. For Andy Murray it's being stronger &amp; faster than his opponents. For the manager it's being able to get the best out of the appraisal process.<br>
<br>
For each scenario there was also an external input of some sort. Someone who sets the standard, can provide immediate feedback and suggest ways in which the expected outcome can be achieved.<br>
<br>
And what are the differences?<br>
<br>
The dog was motivated to change her behaviour because she learnt to associate it with reward or punishment (extrinsic motivation). Andy Murray is motivated to change because, I guess, he wants to win (intrinsic motivation). I was motivated to change because... well, I'm not sure really.<br>
<br>
Changing a dog's behaviour takes time and constant, ongoing reinforcing feedback. Andy Murray's new speed and strength certainly didn't come about overnight, and again will require constant practice and feedback to maintain it. My ability to perform appraisals was expected to be developed over the course of one day and no-one since then has given any feedback on how I do them.<br>
<br>
So what does this mean for the world of "training" in the workplace?<br>
<br>
If we (the learning professionals) a're going to do training properly we need to:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Be clear about what the expected outcomes are - not that we have to make that explicit to the trainee up front, but at least we should be certain about where we're heading. Training is very different from <a href="http://informl.com/2006/05/20/what-is-informal-learning/">informal learning</a> as it's focussed on externally derived outcomes.</li><br>
  <li>Make sure the trainee is given access to an external input who can set the direction of travel and provide feedback and guidance to reinforce the correct behaviour.</li><br>
  <li>Ensure that trainees have clear motivation to change. Without that motivation we are wasting our time. cf. Motivation post. Motivation may be intrinsic (I want to do my job better), or extrinsic (if I do this I will keep my job / get a pay rise / impress my manager).</li><br>
  <li>Forget the idea that you can take short cuts. Good  training is hard work - requiring ongoing coaching and feedback.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Training that works</h3><br>
<br>
If we take those principles into account, then what will an effective, large scale, training regime look like. I would suggest a threefold strategy:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Build in extrinsic motivational factors - most of your trainees will need them. How this works will depend on your organisation, but may include financial reward, status, or recognition. Negative reinforcement may include being able to continue in a particular role or even the removal of certain privileges. Note, I'm not recommending this, just saying that it's a possible motivational factor. Positive reinforcement is always much more effective long term.</li><br>
  <li>Expect managers (at all levels) to be coaches and to provide ongoing, reinforcing feedback. The <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics">Manager-Tools advice</a> on feedback and coaching is invaluable here. This is a major change to the role of most managers - but will be far more effective than expecting a one-hit training workshop to make a difference back in the workplace.</li><br>
  <li>Provide external input which sets the standard and gives examples of "correct" behaviour. Use resources like videos, posters, briefing papers, elearning packages, even a face-to-face workshop with an expert, to ensure a consistent message is available right across the organisation. The precise medium will depend very much on the type of message and who you're training.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
You'll see that the training department is not the only part of the organisation involved in training. It should include senior management to model the coaching &amp; feedback regime, HR to set reward policies, and  Internal Communications to ensure messages are consistent and presented well.<br>
<br>
Training is, and never can be, a fix for poorly designed processes, systems and user interfaces (just see the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7314816.stm">Terminal 5 debacle</a> for an example).<br>
<br>
<h3>Training not development</h3><br>
<br>
Those people who know me will be wondering what's happened. I'm normally a died-in-the-wool constructivist in my approach to learning. The thing is when we're trying to induce specific behaviours &amp; capabilities, then we need a far more behaviourist approach, as proposed above. Constructivist approaches work when we are taking a developmental strategy - where there are no "right answers". If that's where you're heading, then you don't want "training".<br>
<br>
What examples would you say are training and which are development?<br>
<br>
With thanks to <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2008/06/7-bad-language-habits-in-learning.html">Donald Clark</a> for the impetus to put these thoughts down.</div><h1>Recording informal learning for prospective employers</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 July 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>How do you record your learning in a format that prospective employers will understand?<br>
<br>
The accepted tool for communicating your achievements etc is a CV or Resumé. Usually this would have a section devoted to "training", where, traditionally, you would record the courses you've been on.<br>
<br>
However, I've not been on a "course" for probably about five years now (ever since the appraisal training I <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/07/02/training-it-s-what-you-do-to-a-dog?blog=5">mentioned last week</a>). Yet, I've <strong>learnt</strong> more in the past five years than through all the previous ten year's worth of "courses".<br>
<br>
Some of that learning gets recorded on this blog. It's the place where I reflect on things, try to crystallise my thinking, and elicit feedback.<br>
<br>
But what would I put on my CV?<br>
<br>
Prospective employers will see that I've not <strong>done</strong> anything towards personal development. I haven't been on a presentation skills course. Yet what I learnt in 20 minutes through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.manager-tools.com/2006/12/presentation-basics-principle-1/">Manager-Tools podcast</a> made an immediate improvement to my presentations. I haven't been to any conferences about workforce development. Yet what I learn from the regular writings <a target="_blank" href="http://brandon-hall.com/janetclarey/">Janet Clarey</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jarche.com/">Harold Jarche</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.willatworklearning.com/">Will Thalheimer</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/10949212512548432704/state/com.google/starred">among others</a> is far more current than any annual conference.<br>
<br>
I haven't been trained in any of the software I now use, yet through the support available freely on the web I am now proficient (some would say expert) in:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Articulate</li><br>
<li>MindManager</li><br>
<li>Moodle</li><br>
<li>Joomla</li><br>
<li>Etomite</li><br>
<li>Jadu</li><br>
<li>MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Access</li><br>
<li>...</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Similarly, I've never been on any courses about infrastructure or programming. Yet I am confident to work with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Javascript, web servers and XML, knowing that, if I get stuck, I will find the answers I need from other people in similar situations.<br>
<br>
Neither have I been on any courses on how to write and cost business proposals. Yet, through working with colleagues, I've gained enough skills to be able to win consultancy, materials creation and workforce development contracts.<br>
<br>
Where's the proof? Well, it's certainly not in certificate form. There just aren't any. It's in the outputs. But most of those aren't packaged neatly enough to put into a CV.<br>
<br>
How do you do it? What do you put in your CV?

Often these templates come with the source files for the graphics/images. Often these have the extension .psd ie. they're Photoshop files.<br>
<br>
If I needed to edit the graphics, I had two options. I could work with the bitmaps (ie. jpgs, gifs, pngs) - a very painful process. Or I could find someone with Photoshop who could break up the image into its consituent layers and edit them.<br>
<br>
The image editor I use is <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">Paint.net</a>. To my graphically unsophisticated needs it is ideal; a massive step up from MS Paint (yuk!) yet without the learning curve of Photoshop et al. Most of the time I'm just cropping, changing colours, and extracting bits of an image to overlay on another image. Nothing fancy.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. Paint.net is capable of far more than that. I've not scratched the surface yet.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/paint.net.png" alt="Paint.net screenshot" title="" width="484" height="467"></div> <br>
<br>
Today I discovered that I could also open .psd files in Paint.net - using the <a href="http://frankblumenberg.de/doku/doku.php?id=paintnet:psdplugin" target="_blank">Photoshop file plugin</a>. It was a revelation...<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.designsbydarren.com/web_templates/pic.php?id=13" target="_blank">NewsPortal template</a> contains a simple graphic showing three overlaid documents with varying levels of transparency. All I needed to do was changing the basic colour from blue to green.<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/header_bg.gif" alt="blue NewsPortal header" title="" width="400" height="80"></div><br>
<br>
To do so in a bitmap editor was virtually impossible, as there are many different shades of blue in the image.<br>
<br>
Open it up with the Photoshop file plugin in Paint.net and you see the four consituent layers. The bottom one is the plain blue background on which all the white document images sit.<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/layers.png" alt="Layers window" title="" width="195" height="238"></div><br>
<br>
Then all I needed to do was change the blue to the appropriate green and hey presto! (In fact it took longer to write this explanation than to do the whole thing - including install the plugin).<br>

Basically, Clive has put forward a definition of blended learning that describes it as a situation that uses a variety of media in a variety of social contexts (ie. group size).<br>
<br>
To my mind this covers pretty much every learning situation, so I can't see the need for a separate definition of "blended" learning (which should actually be blended <em>teaching</em> anyway, but that's another argument).<br>
<br>
I gave an example from a typical (pre-internet) primary/secondary classroom:<br>
<br>
- self-study (eg. children working through worksheets, reading books etc);<br>
- one-to-one (eg. children reading individually with me)<br>
- small group (eg. children working together on a science experiment)<br>
- larger community (eg. children presenting ideas in school assembly)<br>
<br>
You could equally use a typical face-to-face training session which includes reading, small group discussion, presentation to the wider group, viewing of materials on a screen etc.<br>
<br>
Clive responded with the comment:<br>
<blockquote> "... I must admit that my primary perspective on this issue is work-based learning, where this scenario would be extremely rare."</blockquote><br>
<br>
If that is the case then we are in a very sad situation, where, by trying to constantly find shortcuts to learning we have thrown out everything that we know about how people learn.<br>
<br>
I think it starts at University, where the lecture seems to be the dominant teaching form (regardless of its effectiveness) and we then assume that all adults learn through single medium, single context situations.<br>
<br>
So, workplace learning professionals out there, do you think we need to go back to school to learn how to teach again?</div><h1>Getting feedback from your learners</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 15 July 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Getting feedback from your learners?<br>
How do you get rapid feedback from your learners? Perhaps during a face-to-face session.<br>
 <br>
There are systems available where you give each delegate a small radio transmitter with voting buttons. These then go to a computer which puts the votes on screen.<br>
 <br>
But they cost a lot.<br>
 <br>
If you've got an internet connection then you could use a new website called <a href="http://www.smspoll.net/">SMSpoll</a>.<br>
 <br>
This lets people vote via a text message from their mobile phone, via a form on your website, or via mobile internet devices. The results of the vote are shown immediately on a graph.<br>
 <br>
Don't believe me? Try it out on: http://www.smspoll.net/demouk.php<br>

What do you think? Would it be useful?</div><h1>Open letter to Ed Balls - secretary of state for education</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 July 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This letter (sent to Ed Balls today) was stimulated by <a href="http://www.dougdickinson.co.uk/blog/2008/07/some-common-sense-perhaps.html">Doug Dickinson's ongoing passionate plea for a rethink in the SATs system</a>, and continues <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/05/21/sats_why_oh_why_oh_why">my own small campaign</a> to change it.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
Dear Mr Balls,<br>
<br>
I am writing to express my personal opinion on the issue of SATs testing.<br>
<br>
As a former teacher (secondary and primary), a former primary school governor, a professional elearning consultant and a parent of two children in primary school, I have a keen interest in how we provide an effective education for our children.<br>
<br>
My understanding of the rationale behind the SATs is that they are intended to act as a measure of the school's effectiveness, and therefore a measure of the effectiveness of government policy. I have no problem with this. Such measures are essential if we are to know whether our policies and practices are working.<br>
<br>
I have two issues:<br>
<br>
1) The SATs tests, by focussing on just English, Maths and Science, do not measure the overall effectiveness of schools. For most schools it is logical for them to focus their attention on the areas that are being measured - to the detriment of other subjects. If we believe that PE, Geography, PSHE etc are important parts of our children's education, should these not be measured as well?<br>
<br>
2) The pressure on schools to achieve good results is passed down to the children. This leads to the perceived need for exam coaching, practice tests and private tuition - all of which are unnecessary (as stated by your colleague <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7519595.stm">Estelle Morris</a>). How can we persuade schools to stop putting on this pressure, when their very existence may be subject to the results of the tests?<br>
<br>
I would agree with those people who call for a sampling-led system of measurement. The ideal, in all research, is to take measurements without impacting on the thing being measured. Random sampling of teacher assessments, across the whole curriculum would go some way to alleviating the problems I've outlined above.<br>
<br>
I do hope that the problems you are having with the ETS marking system allow you to rethink how we measure the effectiveness of schools. In the long term, I also hope this leads to a wider rethink of what we really want schools to be doing, as is happening in Scotland.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<br>
Mark<br>

<br>
I know I've said in the past that <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/08/07/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king">Content is (not) King any more</a>, and it's the platform that's the important thing. But we still need to provide centrally generated support for learners. That support usually takes the form of chunks of content which learners have to work through, often in a fixed order.<br>
<br>
<a title="Previous posts" href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/c17/c39/?blog=5">For a long time</a>, I've worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> (a widely-used, open-source course management system). Moodle is built around the twin concepts of <strong>Activities</strong> and <strong>Resources</strong>.<br>
<br>
Activities are things that learners <strong>do</strong>.<br>
<br>
Resources are the things that learners use to help them do the Activities.<br>
<br>
Tom Kuhlmann again hits the nail on the head in his recent post about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/heres-why-unlocking-your-course-navigation-will-create-better-learning/">Why Unlocking Your Course Navigation Will Create Better Learning</a>. Read down, as there's a huge amount of useful advice in the article. But the bit that struck me was:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>... Essentially, the course content is like the reference manual.  The goal isn’t to get them to read all of the content.  Instead, the goal is to get them to DO something.  The content only supports the DOING.<br>
<br>
Considering this, don’t design your course to navigate through content.  Instead, create an environment where the learner has to demonstrate understanding of the content by doing something.  By focusing on the desired action rather than the content, the learner’s better prepared to learn.  The content is just a resource to help them gain understanding.  When you lock access to the content, you’re actually hindering the learning process.  </blockquote><br>
<br>
This fits very closely with Cathy Moore's <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/?p=215">Action Mapping</a> approach to designing learning materials. It creates materials that are focussed on what you want people to be able to <strong>do</strong>. Which, in the workplace, is probably the most important thing we might want to change.</div><h1>Courses and Content</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 December 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've long been an advocate for separating content from courses, but <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/">Cathy Moore's</a> <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/05/learning-designers-required-reading-for?blog=5#c841"> comment</a> on yesterday's post has stimulated me to be a bit more explicit about this.<br>
<br>
Let's put ourselves in the position of the learner (always a good idea for a designer to do).<br>
<br>
Now, this learner may be a novice in the subject, or may be fairly experienced. Since online learning is often intended for large audiences, we can almost guarantee there'll be a mixture of prior experience.<br>
<br>
With the typical elearning course, the learner would be pointed to the start of the course, and given a sequential set of activities to do, supported by in-built resources.<br>
<br>
The learner works through the course, and perhaps finds a couple of useful bits of information. That assumes they haven't fallen asleep or switched off. (BTW - Do you know <em>anyone</em> that has completed one of these typical page-turner courses. I certainly haven't!)<br>
<br>
The next day, the learner needs or decides to put the ideas into practice. Now where were those useful bits of information? Probably embedded in page 17 of 32. But there's no way of finding it without walking through the whole course.<br>
<br>
In a couple of months time, the learner, who is, by now reasonably confident in the subject, realises they need to find out about one particular aspect. They're sure the information is in one of their elearning courses, somewhere. But the only thing the LMS search engine can report on is the metadata attached to the course. It can't search inside the course itself.<br>
<br>
So how is the learner expected to be able to find information outside the course?<br>
<br>
The answer's simple. You have two options:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Build your course <strong>inside</strong> your information system, usually known as a content management system (CMS). This is how <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> works. Each page in the tutorials is built within the CMS, and is thus searchable and individually addressable. You can work through sequentially, use the menu to jump to specific pages, or use the search engine to find specific information.</li><br>
  <li>Build your courses separately from your information. Keep the information in the CMS, and build courses in your LMS.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/course_and_content.001.png" alt="Course and content separation diagram" title="Course and content separation diagram" width="500" height="300"></div><br>
<br>
<h3>Implications of separating course and content</h3><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>You can't create an information resource and call it a course.</li><br>
  <li>You may realise that simply creating materials for people to read is not always the best learning approach</li><br>
  <li>You may start designing-in activities that require people to <strong>use</strong> the content, perhaps even while interacting with each other</li><br>
  <li>You may realise that your learning management system (LMS) is not adequate as it's simply designed to deliver content in a sequence, and has no concept of activities.</li><br>
  <li>You will need to ensure that learners can jump between course and content relatively seamlessly. This means providing mutual links from course to content and vice versa.</li><br>
<br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Implications of <em>not</em> separating course and content</h3><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Your information will be locked away inside courses</li><br>
  <li>Your information will have far less impact</li><br>
  <li>If you try to duplicate content inside both courses and an information system then you will end up with one version that is out-of-date</li><br>
  <li>Your learners will only find information if they manage to get to the page in the course that it's on</li><br>
</ol><br>
<h3>Recommendations</h3><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>If you have a CMS available, then use it as much as you can</li><br>
  <li>If you haven't got a CMS, then get one. There are hundreds. But which one you choose will depend on your precise needs.</li><br>
  <li>If your subject matter expert (SME) gives you a powerpoint to turn into a course, tell them to put it on the CMS first</li><br>
  <li>Don't allow your course designers to embed information in their courses</li><br>
  <li>Use your LMS to take people through learning activities</li><br>
  <li>Get an LMS that provides flexibility in the activities you choose. Eg. <a target="_blank" href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a></li><br>

<!-- Creative Commons License NEWSTYLE license:by-nc nation:2.0/uk display:new --></div><h1>SCORM warning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 April 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Often a potential client will specify that they want their elearning to be "SCORM compliant". When asked why they want this, and to what level of compliance, they often find it difficult to answer.<br>
<br>
<h3>What is SCORM?</h3><br>
<br>
SCORM stands for Shareable Content Object Reference Model. Its history is based firmly in the US Department of Defense's need for learning materials to be able to "work" in many different platforms.<br>
<br>
The DoD, and now <a href="http://www.adlnet.gov/index.aspx" target="_blank">ADL (Advanced Distributed Learning)</a>, looked at the range of different specifications and standards available for learning materials (each one known as a "book") and brought them together in the reference model now known as SCORM.<br>
<br>
SCORM 1.2 (with which I'm most familiar) brings together:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>The IMS content packaging specification - which describes a way of collecting together learning resources into one file (a simple zip package), accompanied by an XML file (called imsmanifest.xml) that describes the structure of the resources. It's this that allows a learning management system (LMS) to upload one file build a navigation structure for learners and track their usage of the navigation.</li><br>
<li>The IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard - which specifies a way of describing the content of the learning object in a machine-readable format. It's this that allows teachers/learners to search for specific learning objects inside the LMS.</li><br>
<li>The AICC run-time specification - which describes how the learning resources should communicate with the host LMS. It's this that allows learning resources to display the user's name, or the LMS to take final scores from quizzes built in to the resources.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
SCORM 2004 builds on 1.2 by tightening up on what it means to be conformant with SCORM, and also adding in a book known as "Sequencing and Navigation". This new book allows designers to programme different routes through the materials based on user behaviour.<br>
<br>
<h3>The benefits of SCORM</h3><br>
<br>
In theory...<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Designers should be able to create materials independently of the host LMS's in-built authoring tools</li><br>
<li>Content is not locked into the host LMS. It can be ported to another LMS with no loss of functionality</li><br>
<li>Learning materials can come from many suppliers and will just "work" in the host LMS</li><br>
<li>Learners will be able to find materials from a catalogue that is populated by the metadata</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>The reality</h3><br>
<br>
Different content suppliers, authoring tools and LMS's have different interpretations of what SCORM means. There is a lowest common denominator (the IMS content packaging specification), but if you want to be sure of interoperability, then you need to stick with that, and that only.<br>
<br>
SCORM-packaged learning content knows nothing about the functionality available in your LMS. So, if you're using an LMS that has collaborative features like forums and wikis, or functions like polls, surveys and sophisticated assessments, all of that will have to be handled outside of the SCORMed content. If you make use of that LMS functionality, you can almost guarantee that the rich information it contains will not be exportable to another LMS.<br>
<br>
SCORM is just about delivering content, tracking its use and providing an overall pass/fail score. It's a model that works for Defence training. Whether it works in other contexts is <a href="http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/content/20021002000737" target="_blank" title="SCORM is not for everyone">debatable</a>.<br>
<br>
The SCORM run-time (and now the Sequencing and Navigation book) are extremely complex to make work well. Often you find run-time information will only get passed between the package and the LMS if you use a particular browser. Very few of the data calls are compulsory in the specification, so you can't guarantee the data you're expecting is going to be available.<br>
<br>
The tracking and score information that comes via the SCORM run-time is of extremely limited use. Yes, it can tell you that someone went into a particular piece of learning, whether they viewed all or some of it, and how long they spent doing so. But a) does it tell you whether they've learnt anything, and b) who is going to be doing the checking up to make sure everyone spent the requisite 10 minutes?<br>
<br>
There are some examples of extremely sophisticated SCORM-based simulations, which work well with a particular LMS, provide useful information to managers, and offer a valid learning experience for learners. Such examples are difficult to come across though.<br>
<br>
<h3>A simple alternative for interoperability</h3><br>
<br>
I would always <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/06/courses-and-content?blog=5">argue that a content management system (CMS) is the best place for content to sit</a>. It's much more learner-friendly.<br>
<br>
Yes, the content is "locked into" the CMS's database, but if you choose the right CMS there will be an export function or the ability to create one.<br>
<br>
If you really need to make sure you can move your content around from one system to another, then there is a simple answer...<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Create your learning materials as a mini-website - any authoring tool will do this</li><br>
<li>Package them into a simple zip file - nothing complicated. Just add them to a compressed folder in Windows, Create Archive on Mac OSX, or tell your authoring tool to zip up the output (Articulate can certainly do this)</li><br>
<li>Upload your zip file to your LMS and unzip it there. Moodle can certainly do this. It's so simple I expect other LMS's should be able to?</li><br>
<li>Create a link to the home page of your mini website from within the LMS. Again, this is built into Moodle. Do other LMS do this as well?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
if your LMS can't handle simple zip files without the content packaging imsmanifest.xml file, then you can use the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&amp;extid=1012681" target="_blank">manifest maker</a> extension for Dreamweaver, or the open-source <a href="http://www.reload.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Reload editor</a>, which is slightly more complex to use but very powerful.<br>
<br>
<h3>In Conclusion</h3><br>
<br>
If you're tempted to specify SCORM as a requirement for your elearning project, make sure you understand clearly which bits of SCORM are important to you, and why.<br>

<br>
I'm bringing these back into the light of day via a separate page on this site: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/19/key-articles-1?blog=5">Key Articles</a>.</div><h1>Personal "analysis" questionnaires</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 September 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Next week I shall be attending my first formal "course" as a learner for over five years!<br>
<br>
Normally I spurn such courses, but this one (on Account and Customer Relationship Management) comes at a time when I need some concentrated input &amp; guidance. Most of the learning I've done over the past few years has been self-directed; based around the serendipitous discoveries made via reading other people's blogs, or through extensive internet research to meet particular needs.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the course I'm going on comes with a little bit of pre-work. Part of it makes you think about the characteristics of successful &amp; unsuccessful client relationships (I like to be in control!). The other part is a questionnaire about whether you have Parent, Adult or Child characteristics, very similar to <a title="PAC Questionnaire" href="http://www.learningnetworkgroup.co.uk/wisdomfiles/PAC%20Questionnaire%20+%20Scoring.pdf">this one (pdf)</a>.<br>
<br>
By long-past background I'm a science teacher, and by recent-background I'm an educational researcher (although that may be stretching it a bit). So, whenever I see tools like these questionnaires I'm looking for evidence that shows the results will be meaningful, and for evidence that the questions have been carefully thought through.<br>
<br>
In this case, I'm afraid I can't find either. To be honest, if the questions aren't carefully thought through, then how can the results be meaningful. This means being totally unambiguous in the language used.<br>
<br>
A couple of examples:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>People nowadays should attend church more often.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I'm a Christian, so you'd probably expect me to say "yes". However, "attending church" isn't going to make anyone a better person; it's deeper than that. So, do I say "no"? But does that mean I'm saying people shouldn't attend church?<br>
<br>
On the same lines:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>The ceremony of baptism is much more than a symbolic ritual - it is essential for the spiritual welfare of the individual.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I really don't like these two part questions. What if you agree with one part, but disagree with the second? That's what I call bad question design.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I did the questionnaire. Whether the results have any meaning at all remains to be seen.

My work takes me into lots of different organisations, and my research &amp; reading has led me to look at a number of different theories of management - particularly the management of learning.<br>
<br>
The following set of questions have no value judgements attached. They are simply to help you describe the current state of your organisation. You could use it in many ways, perhaps with senior managers, or even with a large group to provide evidence for management. But having the description is not enough. You then need to ask those managers "Why is this the case?" for each question. Look out for inconsistencies between the ideal and reality. Again, find out why.<br>
<br>

<br>
It features Lee Myers, a superb classical guitarist, playing a very accessible collection of pieces.<br>
<br>
It's a fund-raising event for Lee and his family as they prepare to move to South America to support the growing church there.<br>
<br>
Tickets cost £8. With only 60 seats available I'd prefer to have the money in advance (I can take Paypal payments) as I've a feeling demand will not meet supply.<br>
<br>
The venue is the historic Gothic Warehouse, part of the <a href="http://www.arkwrightsociety.org.uk/cromford/index.php">Cromford Mills complex</a> - a World Heritage site.<br>

As said <a href="file:///main/index.php/2008/09/25/personal-analysis-questionnaires?blog=5">previously</a>, this was the first formal training course I'd been on for five years. The announcement about the course arrived at a time when I needed some specific input. The objectives matched what I needed. So I signed up.<br>
 <br>
Most of my learning for the past five years has been informal and self-directed. For most of my professional work, I'm at a stage on Jay Cross's graph where that's the most efficient and effective mode of learning. But, with this new role of sales and account management that I'm moving into, I thought that I would be better served by a more formal and structured approach.<br>
 <br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/jay_cross_graph.jpg" alt="Optimise formal and informal learning methods: Jay Cross" title="Optimise formal and informal learning methods: Jay Cross" width="500" height="383"><p>Republished by permission of Jay Cross.

 <br>
Setting aside time to think and reflect is something I try to do anyway in the course of the day job - that's the beauty of my current work; I can manage my own time. But sometimes you need a kick to make you do that thinking, to make you engage fully with the new ideas. That's where having another person, like a trainer or a fellow trainee, can really help.<br>
<br>
In a pre-planned face-to-face training session, however, much of what you do is dictated by the trainer, by the contents of the trainer's handbook, and by the needs of the other trainees.<br>
<br>
That's fine, if all those things are aligned with your own particular training needs. However, in this case the match didn't quite work.<br>
 <br>
There were a few key nuggets which I brought away, but not enough to justify driving 200 miles, spending a night away and being away from the job for a day. Looking back at the stated objectives for the course, it still looks like one that should be useful, but the depth of the content, or its applicability to my own situation was just not quite right.<br>
 <br>
As I design learning solutions for clients, I am tending more and more to an approach that has managers working within a model that emphasises one-to-ones, feedback and coaching (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics/">as promoted by the Manager-Tools team</a>). Managers know their teams and their needs far better than any external trainer, and frequent, planned, short coaching sessions can be far more effective than the blunt instrument that is a training course. The role of the learning &amp; development team is to:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>provide expert resources that managers can use with their teams</li><br>
  <li>provide communication tools that allow communities of practice to develop</li><br>
  <li>support specific interventions that have clearly defined business needs</li><br>
  <li>support and encourage a management culture that has learning at its core</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
In this particular case, I feel I'd have been better off with a couple of hours of coaching, spread over a few weeks, than this one day splurge of training.<br>
 <br>
Oh, and though I now know what Transactional Analysis is, and even how to analyse transactions, I'm still not entirely sure what the point of it all is... can anyone enlighten me?</div><h1>The free tool selection grid</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 November 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a target="_blank" href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/">Jane Hart</a> has made a fantastic contribution to the learning professional's community with her ongoing <a target="_blank" href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/top100.html">top 100 tools</a> list. During this week's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.learntrends.com/">Learning Trends conference</a> she takes that list and pulls out the "25 Free Tools Every Learning Professional Should Have in their Toolbox".<br>
<br>
The discussion that followed included the question: Is anyone worried about free tools that could go away?<br>
<br>
A while back, I wrote a piece for Seb Scholler's blog about <a target="_blank" href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2006/05/free_stuff_in_a.html">Free Stuff in a Commercial World</a>, which discussed the need to understand the business model that was behind the free tools.<br>
<br>
It's important to note that free tools fit into two broad camps:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Closed source, but free to use - eg. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a></li><br>
  <li>Open source - eg. <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> et al</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Tools that fit into either of those two groups can also be in two other groups:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Solid business model or an active development community</li><br>
  <li>No obvious source of funding or active support</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
In the spirit of consultants all over the world, I've put together two grids that may help other learning professionals decide whether a particular free tool is right for them.<br>
<br>
The first takes the ideas above and populates it with free tools (please note these are my current opinions only - I'm prepared to have them changed!)<br>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table align="center" width="80%" border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="30%"></td>
<td width="35%"><strong>Closed source</strong></td>
<td width="35%"><strong>Open source</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Solid business model or an active development community</strong></td>
<td>Google docs, Zoho, Jing</td>
<td>Moodle, b2evolution, Joomla</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><strong>No obvious source of funding or active support</strong></td>
<td>Frappr, Delicious</td>
<td>Nvu</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
Where would your favourite tools sit?<br>
<br>
Of course, there's also longevity and reputation to consider - the longer a tool has been around the more likely it is to stay around. And the more people that think highly of the tool, the more likely it is to stay.<br>
<br>
The second grid looks at the purpose for which you are considering the tool:<br>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table align="center" width="80%" border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="30%"></td>
<td width="35%"><strong>Solid business model or an active development community</strong></td>
<td width="35%"><strong>No obvious source of funding or active support</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Short term tactical goals</strong></td>
<td>Would easily transfer to long term if required</td>
<td>Ideal for experimentation</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><strong>Long term strategic goals</strong></td>
<td>Probably a sensible choice</td>
<td>Living dangerously</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
Basically, you need to consider how important the tool is to you. If it's going to take a long term investment in terms of time and data then you need to be pretty sure it's going to be around for a while.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is exactly the analysis you'd need to do for any paid-for tool. It's not rocket science, just a matter of undertaking a process due diligence before you make your long term choices.</div><h1>Working with Moodle themes</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Moodle is well known for a slight lack of design flair in the out-of-the-box theme packs. That's fine. They still work.<br>
<br>
Often, though, we'll need to redesign the overall look and feel of a Moodle site. Perhaps you need to make it match an existing website, or you just need something that's more in keeping with your particular organisation.<br>
<br>
<h3>Things to note before you start</h3><br>
<br>
Firstly, you don't need to start from scratch. In fact, I would recommend strongly that you don't! Moodle is a very complex application, with many different parts of the interface that need styling. So, I always start with an existing theme and build on that.<br>
<br>
Secondly, remember that each upgrade to Moodle may add new interface elements. If you're not careful these will break your theme. Follow the guidelines below and you should be OK.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, Moodle themes cascade. This means that you can build your theme pack so that Moodle starts by reading the <strong>standard</strong> theme, which will always be kept up-to-date with regard to new interface elements. Once the standard theme is read in, then you can add in your customised theme on top.<br>
<br>
<h3>Step-by-step guidelines to creating a new theme</h3><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Get yourself a locally hosted version of Moodle. You'll find it a lot quicker to build your theme here. It's very easy to install Moodle on both Windows, MacOSX and Linux. <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle">Instructions are here</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Create a new folder in the /themes directory. Remember not to have spaces or non-alphanumeric characters in the folder name.</li><br>
  <li>Copy all the files from /themes/standardwhite into your new theme folder. You will see that standardwhite is a custom theme built on top of the main standard theme.</li><br>
  <li>Use <a href="file:///Users/markberthelemy/Google%20Drive/R&amp;D/LearningConversations/www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> as your browser, with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">web-developer toolbar</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271">ColorZilla colour picker</a> add-ins. Without these, or something similar, your job becomes ten times harder.</li><br>
  <li>Understand how to use the config.php file within the theme pack. Especially how it is used to pull in css files from the <strong>standard</strong> theme, and also from another theme which you would like to act as a parent. If you understand this, it makes building slightly-tweaked themes for specific courses or course categories a whole lot easier.</li><br>
  <li>Create one css file in your theme folder, called overrides.css. Use this to contain any css commands that are specific to your theme.</li><br>
  <li>Add <em>overrides</em> to the line in config.php that starts $THEME-&gt;sheets = ... so it reads <strong>$THEME-&gt;sheets = array('overrides');</strong><br>NB. I normally remove the gradients.css file from the files I copied in from the standardwhite theme. It usually becomes redundant when I created the new theme.</li><br>
  <li>Use the header.html and footer.html files to add in any extra styled divs that you might want to use to wrap the page or to add in horizontal menu bars. You can see both in the image below:<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/moodle_header.png" alt="Moodle header with page wrap and menu" title="Moodle header with page wrap and menu" width="744" height="193"></div><br>
Remember that, if you open a div in the header, you will need to close it in the footer.</li><br>
  <li>Also in header.html add in any logos or other images. Again, you might want to add extra styled divs here, remembering to add those styles to the overrides.css file.</li><br>
  <li>As with all css, start with the big things you want to change: link colours, page backgrounds, overall font styles etc. Then, using the web-developer toolbar, find the specific page elements that need changing, eg. #left-column, #right-column and .sideblock and tweak those.</li><br>
  <li>One thing I always do, in my overrides.css file, is add the lines:<br>
<code><br>
/* needed to remove left &amp; right bars */<br>
<br>
#course-view .section .right a, #course-view .right {<br>
 display:none;<br>
}<br>
<br>
#course-view .section td.left {<br>
display: none;<br>
}<br>
<br>
/* But display for editing */<br>
.editing#course-view .section .right  a, .editing#course-view .right {<br>
  display:inline;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.editing#course-view .section td.left {<br>
  display:inline;<br>
}<br>
</code><br>
These tidy up the course view for students, by hiding extraneous information such as topic numbers, and confusing functionality such as the hide topics button.</li><br>

Basically, it takes the view that learning is a process of making and breaking connections. Those connections can be internal (inside your brain), with other people, or with external knowledge systems (eg. Wikipedia).<br>
<br>
Over the past 12 weeks, George and <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> have been leading a world-wide course with learners who wanted to understand and put into practice the principles of connectivism.<br>
<a href="http://teachweb2.blogspot.com/"><br>
Wendy Drexler</a> was one of those learners. She has concluded the course by creating a <a href="http://teachweb2.blogspot.com/2008/11/cck08-connectivism-networked-studentthe.html">5 minute video</a> (also shown below) in a similar style to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/show">The Commoncraft Show</a>. It explores how a real-life student might use connectivist principles within a particular subject area. It explains how, by using a range of tools and by making connections with other people, he can develop his own body of knowledge.<br>
<br>
The video then asks the question: "So, why does he even need a teacher?"<br>
<br>
In a connectivist learning environment, the teacher's role changes significantly. Rather than being the source or gatekeeper of knowledge, they become:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Learning Architect - putting together the big picture, helping to choose the tools, providing a sense of direction</li><br>
  <li>Modeller - providing an example of how to learn</li><br>
  <li>Learning Concierge - a source of information and support when required</li><br>
  <li>Connected Learning Incubator - providing the conditions in which networked learning will thrive</li><br>
  <li>Network Sherpa - guiding the way around the network</li><br>
  <li>Synthesizer - pulling together collected ideas</li><br>
  <li>Change Agent - stimulating knowledge construction</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
All of these are applicable in any institutionalised learning context, whether school, college, university, or the workplace.<br>
<br>
The difference in the workplace, though, is that many consider learning to happen on the odd day when someone is sent on a training course. In reality, very little true, long term learning takes place on these. Most learning happens in the workplace itself - where your colleagues and your managers take the roles above (often unconciously).<br>
<br>
To make learning more effective in the workplace, I would argue that we need to make those roles explicit, and develop them in managers in particular. Perhaps through something like the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/01/04/more_bang_for_your_buck">Learning to Learn initiative</a> I proposed earlier this year.<br>
<br>
So, what is the role of the external (or even internal) trainer?<br>
<br>
Ideally, trainers would have a medium to long term relationship with their trainees. This would allow them to take on the roles above.<br>
<br>
That long term relationship doesn't have to be face-to-face, but it must exist. Forget the idea that you can take short cuts. Good training is hard work - requiring ongoing coaching and feedback. (See article: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/07/02/training-it-s-what-you-do-to-a-dog">Training - it's what you do to a dog</a>)<br>
<br>
The relationship can be built and supported using available mass-communication techniques - podcasts, forums, blogs. That way, when a face-to-face event does take place it will be far more valuable to the learner as they already have an understanding of the subject matter and the trainer's perspective. The face-to-face event will then be able to focus on practising skills, on coaching and on providing a stimulus towards the next element of change that's required. (See this <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/06/22/what_s_in_it_for_me">description of the Manager-Tools conference</a> for an example)<br>
<br>
If we continue to treat training as a one-off activity, then we will limit its effectiveness, and thus the long term viability of the training department. (See <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2008/11/wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee/">Harold Jarche's timely warning</a>)<br>

<br>
<strong>Monday</strong><br>
<br>
I finished setting up a website to help us run lots of tests. Only people who pass the tests can use a new computer programme that will help teachers and social workers find out who else is working with the children they are helping.<br>
<br>
I then wrote a long review, for one of my clients, of different types of training for managers on the internet. In this I wrote a set of questions so that my client could review more online training that they come across.<br>
<br>
Finally, I ordered another Moodle site that's going to help us train lots of people how to help other people find out information about hospitals and their health.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tuesday</strong><br>
<br>
I built a Powerpoint presentation all about how people around the world use computers and the internet to help them learn.<br>
<br>
While I was doing this I had to help some of my other clients use the websites we made for them.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Wednesday</strong><br>
<br>
I helped a client choose a company that's going to build a really complicated website where people can try out different ways of managing people.<br>
<br>
I made some quick movies with Jing to show one of my clients how to use their new website that we built with Joomla.<br>
<br>
I gave the presentation that I built on Tuesday to a team of people that wanted to learn how schools are changing.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Thursday</strong><br>
<br>
I worked out how much it was going to cost to build a big website containing lots of information about working with a particular council.<br>
<br>
I had a long talk with a team of experts to work out how we can join up our huge Moodle site (that's got 20,000 people in it!) with our SAP computer system that manages all the people in our company. <br>
 <br>
<strong>Friday</strong><br>
<br>
I was planning the training programme where we use the Moodle site I ordered on Monday.<br>
<br>
<br>
There - I told you it was complicated! The amazing thing is no-one has ever taught me how to do any of these things. I've had to learn by finding out, by trying things, and by making mistakes. If you can learn how to learn, then you can do anything!</div><h1>New learning models</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 December 2008</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The presentation below is based on one I did for a workshop a few weeks back.

<br>
Open source learning software means more than just <a href="http://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a>. As well as the ubiquitous LMS, there are open source content development tools (e.g. <a href="http://exelearning.org/">ExeLearning</a>), mind-mapping applications (e.g. <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind</a>), audio-editing tools (eg. <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>), utilities (e.g. <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>), content management systems (e.g. <a href="http://www.etomite.org/">Etomite</a> and <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>), and even <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>, a full-blown competitor to Microsoft Office.<br>
<br>
All of these, and many other open-source applications, are potentially useful for learning professionals - but how do you know that these open-source applications are going to work in your organisation? <br>

</blockquote><br>
<br>
<h2>Rule 1: Will it do what you want it to do?</h2><br>
<br>
That should be the easiest thing to work out. You come up with a set of requirements and the application vendor lets you know which of those things it will do.<br>
<br>
Of course, life’s never as simple as that. I’ve seen far too many requirements that focus entirely on a list of functionality, with no regard for how that functionality is actually implemented within the software. So you could end up with a tool that will do everything you want it to, but no-one will be able to use it.<br>
<br>
There are three approaches to finding out whether software will actually do what you need:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Find someone who knows the software who can look at your requirements and explain how the tool will work in your context</li><br>
<li>Read up all the product documentation that is available</li><br>
<li>Try it out on a small scale</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>The open-source advantage</h3><br>
<br>
With closed-source software you are usually tied to the vendor to get information about the product. Some vendors are excellent at providing information and demonstration versions to look at. Many are less so. Many vendors are happy to send a salesperson to see you - but usually they are biased towards the product.<br>
<br>
With open-source software you'll may need to pay a consultant if you want someone to demonstrate the software and understand your requirements (particularly with a complex application). But at least you are more likely to get an independent view on things.<br>
<br>
Also, with open-source software, there is nothing to stop you taking it and trying it out on any scale. Although you must remember that the more people are using it, and the more you rely on it, the more likely it is that you'll need professional help to use it well. That does depend very much on the type of application though.<br>
<br>
<h2>Rule 2: Will it fit?</h2><br>
<br>
What existing systems will the new software need to work with?<br>
<br>
Will it work on your servers? Will you need additional server expertise or hardware? Where will you get that from?<br>
<br>
Will it need to look like existing systems? Who will do that?<br>
<br>
Will it need to collect data from your existing systems? Can your existing systems provide the data in a compatible format?<br>
<br>
Will it need to supply data to your existing systems? Can it do that already, or will you need additional coding?<br>
<br>
<h3>The open source advantage</h3><br>
<br>
In general, the major open source projects try to follow recognised standards and practices in coding and in linking to other applications. There's no advantage to keeping data inside your particular application; strength is gained by the number of ways you can connect to other development teams and applications.<br>
<br>
<h2>Rule 3: Work out what it will cost</h2><br>
<br>
Not just the license for using it, but in terms of:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>IT infrastructure - servers, bandwidth, faster machines to run it on</li><br>
   <li>installation - on a server or on every person’s desktop</li><br>
  <li>configuration - making sure it fits the way your organisation works, and looks the way you want it to look</li><br>
  <li>training requirements - for administrators, IT technical staff and for general users</li><br>
  <li>support and maintenance - making sure that the software keeps running and is updated frequently</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Basically, as more people begin to rely on the software, the more time and resource you need to use in deploying it.<br>
<br>
<h3>The open source advantage</h3><br>
<br>
With open-source software you don't need to invest vast amounts in the first instance. You can start small and scale up as required.<br>
<br>
<h2>Rule 4: Will I be able to get help?</h2><br>
<br>
The best software companies (in my opinion) support their users in a completely open environment. This isn’t just true for open-source solutions. Examples in the closed-source world include Mindjet’s MindManager and Articulate. I have bought both of those products, partly on the strength of their customer support.<br>
<br>
They will often provide online Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), alongside manuals and examples of good practice.<br>
<br>
Even better is when they open up online forums where users can ask questions which are then answered by both in-house and third-party experts.<br>
<br>
If the software supplier themselves do not provide support, are there third-party organisations that will?<br>
<br>
<h3>The open source advantage</h3><br>
<br>
Because the source-code is open, it means that anyone can have an in-depth understanding of the software. For the popular projects this usually means that you will have a range of options for getting support - from the software developers themselves, or from consultancies, training organisations and other service providers.<br>
<br>
<h2>Rule 5: Is it sustainable?</h2><br>
<br>
It's all about the money - how will you be reasonably sure that development will continue?<br>
<br>
With closed-source software it's usually quite easy to determine how the software development is funded. Funding models for open-source development vary widely. But you need to make sure it’s going to happen somehow.<br>
<br>
Information Week has identified <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/01/the_five_open_s.html">five open-source business models</a>:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Sell support services</li><br>
  <li>Build (or run) hardware that uses your software</li><br>
  <li>Sell proprietary (closed-source) software that complements the open-source code</li><br>
  <li>Sell closed-source licenses for customers who prefer not to be bound by the open-source license conditions</li><br>
  <li>Sell advertising space</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The most popular model by far is that of selling services. Usually it works like this:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Initial code is created by a core team for their own purposes - often using chunks of code from other open-source projects</li><br>
  <li>The code is released as open-source and other people start to use it - often feeding back bugs, ideas, or additional bits of code - the "wisdom of crowds"</li><br>
  <li>Larger users may set up their own development teams to work with the code - these usually feed code back into the Core team.</li><br>
  <li>Experts in the software (including the Core team) may offer services such as consultancy, hosting, customisation or configuration</li><br>
  <li>Sometimes the Core team may have formal accreditation arrangements with service providers which means the Core get a share of any revenue.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
The more popular an application, often the more formalised the development and accreditation processes become - such is the case with Moodle.<br>
<br>
If there is no apparent business model for an application, then it may be that it’s being developed by enthusiasts, who want to make use of the "wisdom of crowds" effect inherent in open-source development.<br>
<br>
If you want to be reasonably certain that development will continue, then you need to play a part in the ecology. That might mean purchasing services from organisations that feed into the development cycle. Or it might mean contributing towards the development cycle yourselves:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Producing chunks of code</li><br>
  <li>Testing pre-release versions</li><br>
  <li>Supporting other users in the forums</li><br>
  <li>Producing documentation</li><br>
  <li>Feeding back on bugs and issues</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Did you know that Microsoft themselves funded the part of Moodle that enables it to connect it with Microsoft’s SQL Server, Oracle &amp; other databases out of the box? (Source: Moodle.org)<br>
<br>
<h3>The open source advantage</h3><br>
<br>
Open-source software has a complex set of business models - which don't always sit comfortably alongside more a commercial cash-based economy. However it does mean that you can contribute to the ecology without necessarily having lots of cash.</div><h1>Be HypeAware</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 26 January 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>As a learning professional I get a lot of material written by companies that want me to buy or recommend their products. I wish, though, there was a little bit more reality in the descriptions and a lot less hype and <a title="Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>.<br>
<br>
As an example, here's an excerpt from a recent <a href="http://www.learnevents.com/learning-magazine.php">Learning Magazine</a>. (NB. Other sources are just as guilty!)<br>
<br>
<blockquote>[Major elearning company] unveiled a global survey that shows roughly seven out of 10 workers have been asked to accomplish tasks without receiving proper training beforehand. Within IT ... the problem is even more pronounced.</blockquote><br>
<br>
The "problem"?! Why is it a problem? It's only a problem if you believe that you have to fill people up with knowledge before they can do anything. Isn't that a rather old-fashioned view of what learning is all about? Do we train our children to walk before they are allowed to take their first steps? No! What we do is give them support and coaching in a safe environment - where failure is OK. To be honest, I quite relish being given a task I've never done before. It gives me something new to learn.<br>
<br>
Then we get onto the buzzwords like SCORM. It sounds great in theory, but is often worse than useless in practice. (See: <a href="file:///main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM Warning</a>)<br>
<br>
And what about about all those articles that reference the pseudo-scientific concept of "Learning Styles"!<br>
For example, the VW case study which talked about some consultants that "found" that apprentices were enthused in the workshop and not in the classroom. They wrapped it in some learning style mumbo-jumbo and redesigned the classroom learning to include more hands-on stuff, more pictures and more reference to popular figures (eg. David Beckham). That's nothing to do with individual learning preferences. It's all about knowing your audience and the sorts of things that they respond to.<br>
<br>
The problem with the learning style approach is that it leads you, if you're not careful, into pigeonholing people, based on a questionnaire they filled in some time ago. In reality, individuals may have different ways of learning that depend on the context, on their emotional state, on the subject covered, on the time of day it is etc.<br>
<br>
Good teachers know that they need to vary how they approach things. How they do that will take into account all those factors. (Just compare how children respond on a Monday morning to a Friday afternoon!) It's not rocket science.

<br>
At the moment, though, users have to be added manually - either through self-registration or through the admin backend.<br>
<br>
I was looking for a script to help automate this for a corporate blogging site I'm working on. There was nothing in the b2evolution forums, but I found one on the Mambo forum - written by Wayne Stewart: <a href="http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=17358">http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=17358</a><br>
<br>
I've adapted it for b2evolution, and added some more code to test whether the users already exist. If they do, then the script exits and asks you to check the existing users in the PHP file. Otherwise you'd end up with multiple users with the same username - bad news!<br>
<br>
The attached zip file contains a php file and a sample csv file. The PHP file should be placed alongside the CSV file in your b2evolution folder structure, and run directly from the browser address bar.<br>
<br>
Please note:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>This is alpha software. There are no warranties, and I can't guarantee I'll be able to support you if you try it out.</li><br>
  <li>For security, please remove the CSV file and the import script from your server after each run</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Things that would improve it...<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Integrate the script more fully with b2evolution's authentication and permissions system, so only admins can run it</li><br>
  <li>Incorporate a browse function to allow CSV files to be uploaded</li><br>
  <li>Make the preset variables populatable from a form</li><br>
  <li>Make the testing mode switchable from a form</li><br>
</ol><br>

I've tried to make the code as fully commented as possible (keeping most of Wayne's original comments). If there are any questions, give me a shout.<br>

In the past, I've found conferences unsatisfactory affairs - often promising more than they achieve. Gradually, though, they are starting to change. These days, the conference or event is often the culmination of professional relationships that have developed online, whether through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">FaceBook</a>, or via the other various blogging, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twittering</a> and RSS-based networks that we have.<br>
<br>
Having that pre-knowledge of the people who will be at the conference enables you to leapfrog the introduction process, since you already have that initial understanding of where they're coming from.<br>
<br>
Having said that, it was a pity that only about 15% of the delegates took advantage of the provided online social network area to interact with people in advance of the conference itself. It feels like people in Learning and Development want to be able to show off all the whizzy technology, but don't actually want to use it themselves.<br>
<br>
I can appreciate that when you're talking about the typical corporate elearning module (as if anyone would volunteer to trawl through one of those!) but we're talking here about a tool that would help delegates get much more value from the event itself. At nearly £1000 per person you'd think they'd want to...<br>
<br>
If we could set an expectation that included pre-conference online activity it would also mean that we could significantly redesign the event itself to make far better use of the face-to-face environment.<br>
<br>
You see, I really don't understand why 1000 people want to go to the effort of coming to one place, simply to sit in rows watching people presenting their ideas. How can you justify that as good use of time?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be better to:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Provide all the presentations beforehand? As videos, as narrated Powerpoints, or even just as old-style conference papers. That way, when you get a really in-depth, thought-provoking session, like <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/">George Siemens'</a>, you can rewind it, take notes, and think about the implications.</li><br>
  <li>Encourage interaction before the event, based on the ideas in the presentations? Wouldn't that start the debating juices going?</li><br>
  <li>Use the face-to-face time to pick up on the issues raised beforehand? Split us up into smaller discussion groups, focussing on specific ideas. Or get the presenter to respond to questions - posed in advance or as an outcome of the discussion groups. Face-to-face time should not be about listening and watching, but about interaction, debate and action.</li><br>
  <li>Pick up on the successful <a href="http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/Organise/">Teachmeet</a> concept, where practitioners sign-up to give micro (7 minute) or nano (2 minute) presentations during a 2-3 hour informal session? Perhaps this could be offered to delegates to the exhibition at a small cost (£30 including free drinks - or get sponsorship from the exhibition stallholders?), to run from 4pm to 7pm?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
So, what I'm saying is... keep the people the same, but stimulate the interaction more, so we really get the full benefit of face-to-face time.<br>
<br>
Of course, this does mean that delegates will have to be set clear expectations about what the conference will involve. That's not impossible - the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/06/22/what_s_in_it_for_me">Manager-Tools team do that very successfully with their conferences</a>.</div><h1>Where are the networks for new teachers?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 February 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've been looking around for networks of new primary teachers (preferably with a UK focus), but can't find any.

<br>
Well, I spent a while wandering around the <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/">Learning Technologies exhibition</a> last month looking for a system that would meet those needs:<br>
<br>
It's very difficult to find them. Underneath all the Web 2.0 marketing guff, most of the Learning Management Systems out there are still doing the same old thing - putting management in the middle, rather than the learner.<br>
<br>
One product that did catch my eye, which I'm investigating further, is <a href="http://www.infinitylearning.co.uk/web/?q=FirtsLookAtInVoLvE">Involve</a> from <a href="http://www.infinitylearning.co.uk/">Infinity Learning</a><br>
<br>
On first looks it hits some of the key points:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Each piece of content should be individually addressable;</li><br>
  <li>The metadata about each piece of content should be fully searchable;</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to find content by searching and sorting, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification">faceted classification</a>, and through automated recommendations (other people who used this also used X);</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to leave comments and ratings against each item of content;</li><br>
  <li>Users should be able to link up with other users with similar interests/learning needs;</li><br>
  <li>It should allow particular groups of users to be targetted with promotions about particular content items;</li></ol><br>
<br>
So far, so good. But, as I <a href="file:///main/index.php/2008/12/30/to-open-source-or-not?blog=5">said at the conference</a>, without testing how a system works in real life, it's very hard to come to any conclusions... Infinity, are you listening?</div><h1>Would anyone notice if we stopped training?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 February 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>How much of what we call training is actually just ticking boxes for someone else's report?<br>
<br>
What would be the <em>real</em> impact if you called a halt to all training activity in your organisation? Would anyone notice?<br>
<br>
When people come to you and say we need training, do you ever ask them why? Keep saying "Why" until you get back to the real heart of the problem, then, and only then, can you suggest a possible solution. That might include training, but it also might include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>changing systems &amp; processes</li><br>
  <li>providing performance support (eg. like Google does so well)</li><br>
  <li>making sure managers are managing</li><br>
  <li>encouraging sharing of knowledge</li><br>
  <li>better internal communications (the vital link between internal comms and training is something I want to explore further - later)</li><br>
  <li>improving recruitment to find people who are ready to learn</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
What proportion of your training activity actually produces meaningful performance improvements? And, if we're not improving performance, why are we training?<br>

(Inspired by something <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/">Donald Clark</a> said, but I can't remember where it was!?)</div><h1>Itiel Dror on factors that affect retention</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 February 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This was originally posted as a response to <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2009/02/itiel-provides-more-food-for-thought.html">Clive Shepherd's post</a>. So read that first, to set the context.<br>
<br>
If you're not going to do that, then you need to know that <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/id/">Itiel Dror</a> was speaking at the Learning Technologies conference. He demonstrated two investigations he'd carried out, which illustrated factors that affected how much people remember after certain periods of time.<br>
<br>
The first looked at how we present information:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>linearly (click next to continue)</li><br>
  <li>content alongside a map of the rest of the content</li><br>
  <li>a map only - which users return to after looking at each piece of content</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The second looked at how people remember more from a health and safety video when they're asked to interact with the video - making choices, identifying issues etc<br>
<br>
I had big questions about Itiel's first investigation. The key thing for me was that the pages of content were unrelated. This, therefore, bears no relation to real-life situations where the content within a site/module is usually related in some way.<br>
<br>
All the learners were being asked to do was remember the content on the pages. So, it may be that the "linear" one just offered fewer distractions and allowed them to focus on one topic at a time.<br>
<br>
Itiel's second test was far more realistic, and therefore far more impressive. It clearly showed the benefits of interacting with the content (as well as people). But then people like <a href="http://terrya.edublogs.org/">Terry Anderson</a> have been <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/149/230">saying that for years</a>.<br>
<br>
The critical thing here is understanding the nature of interaction.<br>
<br>
It's not something that can be added in to the content at the last minute, it needs to be embedded as a coherent part of the way the content works.<br>
<br>
An interaction, for me, is where the learner does something to the content - expecting a response, or vice versa. <br>
<br>
It could be as simple as asking a question which then pushes the learner into the next stage of the materials.<br>
<br>
Or a set of questions which force the learner to reflect on the previous chunk of content. But, write the <b>questions first</b>, then the content.<br>
<br>
Or a branching navigation, where your score is displayed progressively as you make your choices.<br>
<br>
At its most effective, we get games. And here I mean real games, that are engrossing, even addictive, demanding time, ingenuity and imagination from the learner.</div><h1>Ten tips for choosing &amp; using social software</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 November 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>My role often tends to be that of interpreter - helping IT people understand HR/Learning specialists and vice versa. This often means I'm involved in discussions about choosing and using software, particularly social software, often known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">web 2.0</a>.<br>
<br>
HR and Learning &amp; Development see web 2.0 tools in use around the world, connecting people and ideas, and want to make that happen inside their organisation. The IT team see risks, loss of intellectual property and bandwidth hogging. Gross generalisations, I know. But they'll do for now.<br>
<br>
So, here are my top 10 tips for choosing and using software that will help both groups - and their senior managers - achieve their goals.<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Know your audience. Will they readily adopt social software? Are they already active on Facebook/Myspace/Bebo? Do they do social bookmarking with Diigo or Del.icio.us? Are they consumers or producers of information? Do they Twitter? Do they have blogs? Would they know a mashup from their RSS? What can you offer inside the organisation that they can't get outside it?</li><br>
  <li>Find the people that are actively involved in these networks to put together a web 2.0 policy for your organisation. Most corporate policies will be similar. <a href="http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/05/corporate-policies-on-web-20.html">Tony Karrer's collection</a> would be a good place to start. Even the <a href="http://www.doncio.navy.mil/PolicyView.aspx?ID=789">US Navy has a web 2.0 policy</a>.</li><br>
  <li>You will never compete with Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Diigo, Ning etc. Don't even bother. Instead, get them working for you. Sell the benefits of participation. Not just those to the organisation, but those to the individual. Give permission - but, whatever you do, don't make them mandatory!</li><br>
  <li>Learn the capabilities of the free tools like Ning, Wikispaces and Google docs. They are more secure &amp; private than many people realise.</li><br>
  <li>Discover for yourself the benefits of working outside of the <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2009/02/the-leaking-pyramid/">porous pyramid</a>. Join a group on <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> that is in your area of interest. <a href="http://blogsearch.google.co.uk/">Search for blogs about your specialism</a> and collect them using an <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">RSS reader</a>. Perhaps even start your own <a href="http://edubuzz.org/blogs/donsblog/about/">learning log</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Have a NetSafe campaign inside the organisation - focussing on the implications of not keeping your blog / facebook entries / Flickr photos under control. Not just organisational implications, but personal ones.</li><br>
  <li>Start small. Stay under the radar for as long as possible. Let usage grow organically - virally even. A big bang launch will often just lead to unsustainable expectations, and long term negativity.</li><br>
  <li>Collaborative tools, such as wikis and forums need a common factor - a reason for being there, and a reason to contribute. Learn from those that are successful: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bengardner135/meet-jessica">Pfizerpedia</a>, <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager-Tools</a>, <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a>. Consider what makes them so special, amongst the many thousands of "failed" collaborative networks &amp; forums. <a href="http://www.wikipatterns.com/display/wikipatterns/Grassroots+is+best">Understand</a> what helps and hinders adoption. Creating a space for networking is fine, but how will you stimulate people to actually <strong>do</strong> that networking. Learn from conferences - they don't just land people in a room and let them get on with it. They provide stimuli of one sort or another.</li><br>
  <li>Consider how important the data in the social networks is to your people, and to your organisation. This blog is hosted by me, at my expense, because it's my data, and I want it under my control, not my employers. That's why I also don't host it on a free service - however good it might be. Free services are great if the risk to the business is minimal if the service stops. If that risk is great, then think about spending some money, perhaps even bringing it in-house.</li><br>
  <li>If you are looking to source real software, and spend real money, then start by looking at some of the open source tools like <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a> - social network/blog/CPD portfolio, <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> - multi-user blogging, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">Scuttle</a> - social bookmarking, <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a> - RSS aggregator, <a href="http://www.dimdim.com/">Dim Dim</a> - virtual meetings.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Three final points - just to wrap up...<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Whatever you do, get your IT team on board, so they're aware of what you're doing and understand what you're trying to achieve.</li><br>
  <li>Always think about it from your user's perspective. On the web, if it's too hard, people will lose interest and go to something else.</li><br>
  <li>Don't be afraid to get help. The technology's the easy bit. It's making it work for you that's far, far harder.</li><br>

The difference is that you will need to be much more explicit in your thinking, rather than relying on gut instinct.<br>
<br>
When I start out with a new learning programme I try to split my work into three core areas:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Learning architecture</li><br>
<li>Technology infrastructure</li><br>
<li>People (probably the most important)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Getting the learning architecture is important, but, if you get the technology or the people aspects wrong then nothing's going to make the learning work!<br>
<br>
Much of the thinking is iterative; as soon as you get one thing sorted you need to go back and work out its impact on the rest of the design.<br>
<br>
Throughout the process, the role of the Solutions Architect is to balance the needs of the organisation and the needs of the learner with the resources available (eg. systems, budgets, people).<br>
<br>
Just like in a real-world building project, getting the architect in early is essential. On large-scale projects there's no point giving the builder their instructions on what to build, and then bringing in an architect to make sure they do it properly. The architect is the link between your organisation's real (rather than perceived) needs and the solution to those needs.<br>
<br>
<h2>Learning architecture</h2><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/learning_architecture_500.png" alt="Learning architecture iteration" title="Learning architecture iteration" width="500" height="256"><p>Building a learning architecture</p></div><br>
<br>
<h3>Business need</h3><br>
<br>
Before you even start thinking about what the learning programme is going to look like you need to consider the problem that it is meant to solve.<br>
<br>
It might be that your client organisation is wanting to explore new approaches to a particular aspect of its work, where the outcome is uncertain.<br>
<br>
Or there may be a need to proove that the organisation has complied with particular legal or regulatory requirements. (I'll leave it for others to debate whether that means training is the only solution.)<br>
<br>
Perhaps the organisation needs to ensure that there is a consistent skill base across the whole workforce.<br>
<br>
Your client might have decided that people need a raised level of knowledge and understanding of what you do.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps there's a strategic need to change behaviours across the organisation.<br>
<br>
Whatever the business need, you must understand it. And you must get to the bottom of the reasons behind that business need. Alongside that you'll need to know very quickly what drives the organisation's culture. Without those two converging streams of understanding, you will find it extremely difficult to create a learning solution that matches the client's needs and expectations.<br>
<br>
There are two tools that really help in this process with clients. One is <a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2008/05/be-an-elearning-action-hero/" target="_blank">Cathy Moore's action mapping presentation</a>. This, very clearly, shows the client the importance of focussing on what they want people to <strong>do</strong>, rather than know.<br>
<br>
The other tool I use considerably, especially in client workshops, is some sort of visual mapping tool. Options here include:<br>
<ul><br>
<li><a href="http://www.mindjet.com/" target="_blank">MindManager</a> - a very powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_blank">mind mapping</a> tool that integrates well with MS Office.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind</a> - an open-source mind-mapping tool. Fast and simple to use.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html" target="_blank">CmapTools</a> - a free <a href="http://cmapskm.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1064009710027_1483270340_27090&amp;partName=htmltext" target="_blank" title="Concept map about concept maps">concept-mapping</a> tool</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
These tools are useful to both collect ideas together, and then to re-present those ideas back to the client as your understanding of what they are trying to achieve.<br>
<br>
<h3>Measurement</h3><br>
<br>
As an adjunct to understanding the business need, you will also need to understand your client's expectations of what they will measure.<br>
<br>
As soon as you put any part of a learning programme online, you run the risk of measuring things just because they are easy to measure, rather than because they are important. Online learning provide huge amounts of data about what learners are doing and when they're doing it. Much of that data might be useful as aggregated statistics (given a large enough population sample), but it tells you very little about the individual learner.<br>
<br>
The challenge is to find the things that you can measure that will give you meaningful information about whether you are achieving your business needs.<br>
<br>
Consider what it is you want to find out:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Learners' skill levels before and/or after the learning intervention?</li><br>
  <li>How your learning intervention is perceived?</li><br>
  <li>How many people took up your offer of the learning intervention, and to what extent</li><br>
  <li>Whether your learning intervention made any difference to learners' behaviour?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
You'll also need to consider whether the measurements are "high stakes". In other words, are other actions dependent on the results of the measurements.<br>
<br>
<h2>Next time</h2><br>
<br>
In the next installment of this post, we will look at the routes a learner will take to, through and after your intervention - the learner's eye view...<br>

<br>
He starts from the point at which you have chosen to use Moodle, and systematically introduces each element of the administrator's role:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Installation</li><br>
  <li>The Moodle system</li><br>
  <li>Course management</li><br>
  <li>User management</li><br>
  <li>Roles and permissions</li><br>
  <li>Look and feel</li><br>
  <li>Configuration options</li><br>
  <li>Monitoring activity</li><br>
  <li>Security</li><br>
  <li>Performance and optimisation</li><br>
  <li>Backup and restore</li><br>
  <li>Third party add-ons</li><br>
  <li>Moodle networking</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
In doing so, he covers virtually every aspect of being a Moodle administrator.<br>
<br>
These types of reference manual usually answer the questions:<br>
<blockquote><br>
<strong>How </strong>do I do a particular task?<br>
<strong>What </strong>are the options available to me?<br>
<strong>Why </strong>should I choose a particular option?<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Moodle administration answers the "How?" and "What options?" questions admirably, in clear language with screenshots throughout.<br>
<br>
Much of this is available in the online <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle documentation</a>, so it could be argued that the book version is immediately out-of-date as compared to the online version. Yet, having the information in book format, allowed me to discover for the first time a number of Moodle features - notably those around performance and optimisation.<br>
<br>
The book could be improved, particularly in the earlier chapters , by addressing more of the "Why?" questions. Not necessarily "Why Moodle?" (that's a book in its own right!), but, for example, looking at the impact of:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>choosing a hosted solution over self-hosting</li><br>
  <li>managing authentication and enrolment via an external database over self-service authentication and enrolment.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The book also seems to assume that most people will be hosting their own Moodle sites, and thus goes into a lot of detail around the technical aspects of installing, optimising and securing the software.<br>
<br>
I tend to recommend that organisations will be better off procuring a hosted service which handles all of those aspects, unless any one of these apply:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The organisation has a robust technical and support infrastructure</li><br>
  <li>The organisation wants to integrate Moodle with other systems inside the firewall</li><br>
  <li>The organisation wants to make major changes to the Moodle core code</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Most small to medium organisations don't have these requirements or the infrastructure and so opt for hosted solutions, often from a <a target="_blank" href="http://moodle.com/partners/">Moodle Partner</a>. Administrators in these situations may be scared off by the first chapters about installing Moodle, LAMP architecture etc. They will want to go straight to Finding your way... , and then onto Course Management. This could, perhaps, be signposted better.<br>
<br>
Even so, I have a number of clients to whom I will be recommending this book wholeheartedly.<br>

Publisher: Packt Publishing</div><h1>Learning &amp; Skills group conference review</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The <a href="http://www.learningandskillsgroup.com/events.cfm" target="_blank">Learning &amp; Skills Group conference</a> today was probably one of the best learning events I have ever been to.<br>
<br>
It was very much an interactive event, with few "speakers" and lots of conversation.<br>
<br>
Key thoughts that I came away with:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Learning &amp; development and internal communications are (or should be) just different views of the same thing.</li><br>
  <li>Many organisations find that motivating their employees to take responsibility for their own learning is a limiting factor.</li><br>
  <li>Changing behaviour is one of the main reasons for having a learning &amp; development function. The experts in changing behaviour are marketing people. L&amp;D can learn a lot from marketing...</li><br>
  <li>Single-sign-on between systems is critical to the success of a learning strategy that comprises of "small pieces, loosely joined".</li><br>
  <li>An effective global search across systems (cf. Google) can significantly increase the likelihood of people using your content and systems.<br>
</li><br>
  <li>Open source software is being seen as a valid option, with the recognition that it still comes with a price.</li><br>
  <li>Compliance training is a necessary evil. It has no effect on learning or behaviour, but exists purely to tick a box.</li><br>
  <li>Management understanding of the implications of learning technologies is a limiting factor to their successful adoption.</li><br>
  <li>Bottom-up initiatives often fail when they become too popular as the infrastructure is not there to handle them.</li><br>
  <li>Top-down initiatives often fail because end-users do not buy-in to them.</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Aggregated health records - who do we trust?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 July 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Through recent events I've become acutely aware of how completely disorganised is the National Health Service's methods of keeping patient records. Every GP (general practitioner), hospital, consultant, dentist, physiotherapist, geriatric unit, and occupational therapist keeps their own records. Those records sit in computer systems or on bits of paper. Sometimes the different agencies talk to each other. More often they don't.<br>
<br>
This leaves patients and their families to try to pull together all these disparate pieces of information into a coherent whole.<br>
<br>
The NHS is currently going through an immense IT project to try to build a national patient record system. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7887438.stm">It sounds like</a> this is well over budget, over time, and doesn't work. It's by far the biggest project of its kind. Perhaps it's too big to ever work?<br>
<br>
Instead of a monolithic system, how about adopting a "small pieces, loosely joined" philosophy. And instead of the doctors controlling what goes into your record, let the patient decide who they trust with their data?<br>
<br>
Each individual could have a data store. It could be on an ID card, on a tag that you keep around your neck, on a USB stick, on a secure website even.<br>
<br>
Whenever you need to see your doctor, consultant, therapist, insurance company etc you give them access to the records you want them to be able to see.<br>
<br>
When the consultation or hospital stay is over the notes kept will be sent to your data store.<br>
<br>
There are numerous political and technical barriers to get over to make this succeed:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The data will need to be stored in a consistent, standardised format?</li><br>
  <li>A range of transport mechanisms will need to be agreed and standardised</li><br>
  <li>Data security concerns will need to be addressed through simple, but effective encryption and authentication mechanisms</li><br>
  <li>Software and hardware providers will need to comply with an accreditation or registration process which provides a stamp of approval</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
None of this is easy. But, once the ground rules are in place and placed in the public domain, it allows a much more distributed development process than is currently happening. We might even get a system that works.</div><h1>Learning &amp; development and internal communications are (or should be) just different views of the same thing</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 July 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div class="image_block"><img src="./assets/elephant_silhouette_sm.png" alt="Elephant silhouette" title="" width="300" height="215"></div><br>
<br>
If you look at L&amp;D and at internal communications, very often they have the same objective: to change the way employees behave or think.<br>
<br>
Why are they seen as separate functions? Why are the intranet, internal magazine and poster campaigns run by internal comms, whilst induction materials and management training are run by the L&amp;D department? Is the difference in function really that great? Surely, if they were put together there'd be a far greater coherence in the messages going out. The creative synergies between the two departments would be huge!<br>
<br>
While we're at it, let's bring in Change Management, Compliance, Operations, Marketing and Research &amp; Development.<br>
<br>
If we work together in cross-specialist teams, then we won't be tempted to solve every business problem with a course, or with whatever our personal favoured strategy might be.<br>
<br>
We might even learn something.</div><h1>Taking responsibility for learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Post no. 2 in my further reflections on the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/06/09/learning-aamp-skills-group-conference-re?blog=5">Learning &amp; Skills group conference</a>.<br>
<br>
Many organisations find that motivating their employees to take responsibility for their own learning is a limiting factor.<br>
<br>
Motivation is the internal condition that activates behavior and gives it direction; energizes and directs goal-oriented behavior. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation">Wikipedia 30/07/09</a>)<br>
<br>
It comes in two forms; extrinsic and intrinsic.<br>
<blockquote><br>
Intrinsic motivation is the internal desires to perform a particular task; people do certain activities because it gives them pleasure, develops a particular skill, or it’s morally the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Extrinsic motivation is the factors external to the individual and unrelated to the task they are performing.  Examples include money, good grades, and other rewards.<br>
<br>
(<a href="http://www.fiu.edu/~cryan/motivation/intrinsic.htm">Dr. Ryan on motivation</a>) <br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Without motivated learners we (learning designers, trainers, tutors, authors etc) may as well just give up. Nothing we could do would make any difference at all.<br>
<br>
Ideally, we would move from learners being reliant on extrinsic motivating factors to intrinsic factors. That's the point at which they have then taken responsibility for their own learning.<br>
<br>
A question I always ask at the outset of any learning design project is: "Why are learners going to engage with these materials / activities?"<br>
<br>
Too often, the answer comes back: "Because we'll tell them to."<br>
<br>
I'm sorry. That's not enough. All you'll get then is conscripts. People who don't really want to be there. If they do learn anything, or change their behaviour as a result then that will be a fluke. This is less true of face-to-face interactions as the facilitator/trainer can do more to engage the delegates when they arrive.<br>
<br>
With online learning, however, <strong>the learner is in total control</strong>. If they're not motivated in the first place, you've got an incredibly difficult job to engage them - when they can so easily just turn off at any time. At best, they might just click through your materials...<br>
<br>
So, how do we move individuals from being unmotivated to learn through to taking responsibility for their own learning?<br>
<br>
Based on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/04/10/command-aamp-control-vs-learning-anarchy?blog=5">my experience of that particular journey</a>, I would suggest the following ideas:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Be explicit about "What's in it for me?" whenever you're trying to promote anything new.</li><br>
  <li>Take more of a <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/10/10/coaching_aamp_me?blog=5">coaching attitude to management</a>, rather than providing all the answers.</li><br>
  <li>Develop a culture of personal responsibility. Wider than just learning, this should include performance, finance and mistakes.</li><br>
  <li>Allow mistakes to happen. But make sure all concerned learn from those mistakes. "What did you learn today?" should become a standard question in team meetings.</li><br>
  <li>Provide access to resources and networks, and help people see how they can get the most out of them.</li><br>
</ul><br>

<br>
Far too often I come across people asking for "learning modules" which are intended to change behaviours or develop skills or knowledge, yet many times are purely about providing  information, hints, tips, guidance etc.<br>
<br>
So what is it that makes an information module into a <em><b>learning</b></em> module? The secret ingredient is feedback.<br>
<br>
For simple changes that feedback could be given programmatically. ie. through the learning module itself. (Please note that I have not specified <strong>online</strong> - a learning module can be delivered through a book, a DVD, a podcast etc). Programmatic feedback is a means of allowing the learner to interact with the material and the material provides feedback on performance.<br>
<br>
The more complex the change required, the more complex the programming will need to become. This can lead to the sorts of Serious Games and simulations that are starting to make an impace now.<br>
<br>
There comes a point, though, when human interaction is essential to give feedback. For financial reasons this is usually minimised as much as possible. Yet that can be a short-sighted decision which means that all the work put into the module materials does not bear fruit.<br>
<br>
Human feedback can come from the learner's peer group (through action learning sets, or online forums), from a "tutor" (again using either face-to-face or online means), or from a manager (via coaching or one-to-ones).<br>
<br>
The most cost-effective of these ought to be the manager. They know the learner the best. They work with them on a daily basis, and they understand the changes needed, and the context within which the learner is working.<br>
<br>
That's the ideal. Many organisations, however, don't seem to work in that way, and the feedback process is either left out or handled by professional trainers who will only see the learner maybe once or twice.<br>
<br>
Only once have I worked on a project where management coaching, feedback and facilitation was a central part of ensuring the effectiveness of the learning module. It was expensive to implement; requiring some upskilling of the managers - but, by all measures, it was a great success. It achieved all its stated objectives (including leading to measurable improvements in the business), and left a workforce that was ready for further changes.<br>
<br>
If we don't build feedback into our training, then we may as well not bother if we want lasting change.<br>

That might mean writing code, but more often it means configuring applications and tweaking existing code to meet client requirements.<br>
<br>
I enjoy the challenge of working out what system is really going to solve a particular problem and then making that system work in as simple a way as possible.<br>
<br>
Over the years I have learnt a number of key lessons when it comes to designing &amp; implementing software. In most cases the design is treated as all important, with very little attention paid to how the software is to be implemented.<br>
<br>
There are two scenarios I'd like to explore here:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>When software is designed and delivered that meets all the needs only to find that very little of its potential is used by the organisation.</li><br>
<li>When an organisation begins to rely on the software.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So we're looking at two basic issues:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Getting the most out of the software</li><br>
<li>Supporting the software appropriately</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>Getting the most out of the software</h3><br>
<br>
You would have thought that the most important thing is to make sure the software is easy to use and well-designed. From what I've seen that just isn't true. There is a lot of software in place that is poorly designed and hard to use, yet it still gets widely adopted. Conversely, there are even more well-designed systems that get implemented but just sit dormant until they get scrapped.<br>
<br>
The common factor in all these tends to be buy-in, of the lack of it.<br>
<br>
<h4>What's in it for me?</h4><br>
<br>
If the managers or decision makers in an organisation cannot see the point of a system then they are unlikely to get behind it. Only if it directly supports their <strong>real business needs</strong> (eg. increase efficiency, sell more widgets, get better exam results etc) will they invest in it, promote it or even mandate its use.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the end-users of the system will always ask "What's in it for me?". If it's not immediately obvious then they will often ignore the system. Anyone implementing any new system or initiative (not just software) must always consider what is going to motivate the end-users to adopt it. That might be factors such:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>"It's the only way I'll get my expenses paid"</li><br>
<li>"It will let me find information more easily".</li><br>
<li>"I have to use it so I can get this qualification"</li><br>
<li>"I will save time if I use this software."</li><br>
<li>"I will be able to do my job better"</li><br>
</ul><br>
Many people describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation">motivation</a> as having two types: intrinsic and extrinsic. Extrinsic includes things that come from outside the person. Things like money, qualifications, promotion etc. Intrinsic motivation is internal; things like professional pride, personal interest.<br>
<br>
The motivating factors that you need to consider will depend very much on the target audience, on their confidence with the technology, on their perceived needs, and on the things that drive them. You can only understand that if you <strong>know your users</strong>. Get as close to them as you can. Try not to rely on the rose-tinted views of experts and senior managers.<br>
<br>
<h4>Sell, sell, sell</h4><br>
<br>
Once you've understood the drivers behind the decision makers and the users, and you're sure that the software you've got will meet those needs, you need to sell the key messages. One part of any successful software implementation is a <strong>clear communication plan</strong> that identifies the features and benefits of the new software and puts them across in a way that a) persuades people that they want to use it and b) encourages people to use it better.<br>
<br>
Here we need to take our lead from the consumer marketplace. What is it about <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> marketing that makes it so memorable? (See below) How do <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/">Mindjet</a> highlight the benefits of mind-mapping with their software and also communicate how to use it more effectively?<br>
<br>
[youtube]6dfTf-FsLtc[/youtube]<br>
<br>
If there is an internal communications team then work with them. If not, then look at what already works with your target audience and use that.<br>
<br>
<h4>Hardware, software and training are equal partners</h4><br>
<br>
I've always subscribed to the view that the funding for most IT projects should be split equally between hardware, software and training. Where training includes all the people-centred activity that is not directly related to purchasing boxes or writing code.<br>
<br>
Those training &amp; communication activities are often left as an afterthought, whereas successful implemtations build them in from the start.<br>
<br>
One of the great things about using Open Source software is that it allows you to spend more on training and the other "softer" things that will make the project successful. Just look at the <a href="http://moodlea.blogspot.com/2007/10/moodle-training-and-some-tools-to-help.html">Moodle project in Buckinghamshire schools</a> to see how focussing on training and CPD has made a real difference to how well the software has been adopted.<br>
<br>
It's not just training per se. Any software implementation should consider:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>User documentation</li><br>
<li>Local champions</li><br>
<li>Context sensitive help</li><br>
<li>Telephone support (tools like TeamViewer are invaluable here)</li><br>
<li>Ongoing hints and tips</li><br>
<li>User forums</li><br>
</ul><br>
Not all of the above are appropriate in every situation. User forums, in particular, depend very much on the IT confidence and the size of your userbase.<br>
<br>
There's been a lot of research and thinking around encouraging adoption. Here are some starting points. Wikipedia is a good place to start, by looking at the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">Diffusion of Innovations</a>. As always with Wikipedia, follow the links to the source documents.<br>
<br>
<h3>Supporting the software appropriately</h3><br>
<br>
Once the software is in place, and being used, everything is OK, yes?<br>
<br>
No. As soon as the organisation begins to rely on it that's when your headaches really begin.<br>
<br>
I've made the mistake too many times in the past of setting up software for people who come to me because I can help them at that stage, but then find that one person on his own just isn't sustainable in the long term. Any system that is going to become mission-critical in any way needs a long term strategy, with the right teams in place.<br>
<br>
Anyone implementing software needs to ask these sorts of questions:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>What would be the impact if the software stopped working?</li><br>
<li>How will the software handle large amounts of usage?</li><br>
<li>How often will the software need to be updated?</li><br>
<li>How will updates be tested and released?</li><br>
<li>Where will users go for support?</li><br>
<li>How will changes to the IT infrastructure affect the way people use the software?</li><br>
<li>How will changes to other systems impact on the way the software works?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
All this requires an IT and application support infrastructure that is appropriate to the size of the organisation.<br>
<br>
You may need to make sure you've considered:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Server hardware - including setting up appropriate levels of monitoring, load-bearing, redundancy and disaster recovery</li><br>
<li>Network infrastructure - looking at bandwidth and firewall setup and monitoring usage</li><br>
<li>Database administration - focussing on optimising the database server and monitoring its capacity</li><br>
<li>Platform software - maintaining all the underlying software that your application relies on, eg. web servers, scripting languages</li><br>
<li>Application support - focussing on the software you've put in, making sure it's working properly, talking to the other systems it should be talking to and dealing with user queries.</li><br>
<li>Software development - focussing on the maintaining the software with new releases and testing those new releases before they go live.</li><br>
<li>Coordination - making sure that all the relevant parties talk to each other before making any changes.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
That's the problem with Open Source software; it's often too easy to setup. The low cost (ie. free) of the software itself makes it very simple to implement. That's great if you're just trying it out, but if it's going to scale up you must make sure you have planned for that, and are prepared for the costs involved. With proprietary software many of those costs are subsumed into the licence cost. With Open Source software they become explicit and part of your (or your provider's) responsibility.</div><h1>Teaching online forces better pedagogy</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 September 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Michael Feldstein, in responding to a comment on his <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/review-sakai-courseware-management/">review of a Sakai book</a>, made a statement that I wish I could agree with wholeheartedly: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Teaching online is completely different. There is no stage. You have no captive audience. You have no ability to lean on your physical presence and stagecraft as a teacher. What you do have is the wide world that the student is immersed in, and the student’s imagination and initiative. So that’s what you use. One of the reasons that I love working in this field is that <em>it forces teachers to try better pedagogical practices that they then often bring back to the physical classroom</em>.</blockquote><br>
<br>
From my experiences both in HE (as a post-graduate student) and in corporate learning (as a learning technology specialist), I can say categorically that the last phrase (in italics) just isn't true. There's nothing that can <em>force</em> a teacher, tutor or materials designer to try better pedagogical practices. You'd hope that their professional pride would lead them down that route, but the pressures of time and money, as well as a lack of understanding of pedagogy often dictate otherwise. So, often, you end up with far worse experiences online than happen in a classroom.<br>
<br>
What I do agree with totally is that teaching online is completely different. Perhaps we should just accept that and not expect good classroom trainers/teachers to be good online trainers/teachers, and vice versa?</div><h1>Blended learning - a personal definition</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 September 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Blended learning means making full use of the available resources, environment and people to help learners learn. It may or may not include using computer-based systems. Any good teacher or tutor uses a blended approach to their teaching. Any learner who is engaged with their learning will use a blended approach to their learning.<br>
<br>
Examples include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A management trainer using a mix of group activity, chalk &amp; talk, and individual reflection</li><br>
  <li>Someone learning how to use Excel, by using a mixture of trial &amp; error, a reference book and the Excel help files.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
It could be argued that all learning is blended, but some teaching is not blended. All good teaching is blended.<br>
<br>
Just because a learning programme is blended (ie. uses a mixture of approaches), it does not mean that the learning programme is going to work. The design of the interface between the different approaches is crucial, so that learners are never left wondering what they should do next.<br>
<br>
Providing a choice of approaches and materials is good for "advanced learners"; people who know how to use that choice effectively, who know how to learn. Many learners, particularly when starting out on a new area of learning, often need far more structure. In this case a linear, timeline driven mix of activities and resources can often be the best design.</div><h1>The blind leading the blend - a response</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 September 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This post was stimulated by Norman Lamont's article: <a href="http://normanlamont.typepad.com/eellearning/2009/09/the-blind-leading-the-blend.html">The blind leading the blend</a>. The comment got too long, so I've turned it into its own post here:<br>
<br>
Norman, I agree with your analysis that people tend not to go through materials prior to "the big day".<br>
<br>
One way to minimise that is to make delegates actually do some work prior to the event. Eg. an assessment, prepare a case study etc. Then make it really clear that they will be expected to present/talk about their work on the Big Day.<br>
<br>
I've done it both ways - using prior materials, and using forums etc afterwards. Whether they work depends totally on the context in which you're working:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
   <li>What are the learner's expectations? How are they set?</li><br>
  <li>What level of e-confidence do the learners have? That's not just IT confidence, but their confidence in communicating online.</li><br>
  <li>What are their manager's expectations - particularly around use of time for learning?</li><br>
</ol><br>

<br>
My number one thought was, initially, "Don't make me think", after the brilliant web design book by <a href="http://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug</a>. However, for an application to work for someone without them needing to think, it means the application must immediately fit their current ways of working and frames of reference.<br>
<br>
For the past ten years, I've been working in the field of learning technologies; helping people to change their frames of reference, to change the way they work, to see the benefits that the online environment can bring to learning.<br>
<br>
If we create applications that simply mirror existing processes, how can we expect change to happen?<br>
<br>
BTW, my top five aspects for web application design were:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Code that has <strong>security</strong> at its heart; where every user entry field is checked and cleaned, where privacy is built into the architecture of the application, where you know who will be able to see what you write/upload<br>
</li><li><br>
Code that I can <strong>trust</strong> to do the job well. Has it been tested? By whom? How many testers? Who else trusts it? Do I trust their recommendation? Who develops it? How robust is the development team? Will they maintain the code?<br>
</li><li>Clear <strong>navigation elements and workflows</strong> that let me understand quickly what the application is about and what it can do.<br>
</li><li>Design that <strong>works across browsers and devices</strong>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation">degrading gracefully</a>, (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">enhancing progressively</a>). It should allow me to use my browser how I like to use it (eg. text sizes, colours, window size, toolbars). Any application that opens in a new, fixed sized window with no menu bars and the right click menu disabled should be banned!<br>
</li><li><strong>Consistency, consistency, consistency</strong>. Don't introduce new User Interface elements for the sake of it. Use existing design patterns (eg. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo's design pattern library</a>) whereever possible. And then, within the application, use those design patterns in a consistent way.</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Are you a learning solutions architect?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 October 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>A Learning Solutions Architect works in a very similar way to a real-world buildings architect. They act as the central point for the design of a solution. They get to understand the client's needs and wants intimately. They know that their solution must fit into the existing infrastructure and surrounding landscape. They can explain complex ideas simply to the many interested parties - in their language. They have to be flexible and work within fixed budgets.<br>
<br>
So, how do you know if you're a learning solutions architect? Here are a few scenarios that I come across on a regular basis. Let me know if they ring bells with you.<br>
 <br>
Do you ask your clients "Why?" more often than they might be comfortable with?<br>
Do you turn complex ideas into simple pictures?<br>
Do you act as an interpreter between IT and Learning &amp; Development?<br>
Do you talk to IT about bandwidth, hosting, firewalls and browser compatibility?<br>
Do you talk to Learning &amp; Development about the differences between behaviourist, cognitivist, constructivist and connectivist approaches to learning?<br>
Do you talk to the Programme team about where learning, and its associated systems, fit into the wider picture?<br>
Do you have a healthy appetite for learning about new tools, systems and ideas that might have a place in future designs?</div><h1>Review: Testlink - an open source test management system</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Testing is one of those tasks, like writing documentation, that most of us tend to avoid until abolutely necessary. A good test process, however, should help to ensure that you deliver exactly what the client ordered, and allow you to prioritise fixing problems in the your system.<br>
<br>
Depending on the size of your project, and the number of interlinked systems, you may have a number of different stages of testing activity, such as:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Unit testing - looking at each component part of one system</li><br>
  <li>Unit link testing - looking at whether the "units" fit into their host system OK</li><br>
  <li>Systems testing - looking at the whole of one system</li><br>
  <li>Integration testing - looking at how the different systems join up</li><br>
  <li>End-to-end testing - running the whole process through, from start to finish</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Each stage will have <strong>Test Plans</strong>, that link back to a <strong>Test Specification</strong> which contains <strong>Test Cases</strong>, that are based on a <strong>Requirements Document</strong> which will have come from the client. The Test Plans are execute for each <strong>Release</strong>, and results collected along with appropriate evidence.<br>
<br>
That does not just apply to software - it applies to any system or process that you have to make sure works in a consistently reproducable way.<br>
<br>
As you can imagine, managing testing across multi-disciplinary teams, with multiple systems and a suite of Requirements Documents, can be pretty complex - particularly if you need to maintain an audit trail showing what has been done, when, why and by whom.<br>
<br>
Spreadsheets are often the first port of call for collecting the information together. However, very quickly, you end up with multiple versions, used in different ways by different teams, and no easy way to track the data through them.<br>
<br>
The obvious solution is a multi-user relational database that:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>contains all the test information about the testing on a particular project</li><br>
  <li>allows particular users permission to update particular fields through data entry forms</li><br>
  <li>provides reports on the whole test process</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.teamst.org/">Testlink</a> is such a product. So far, it's the only one I've seen, so I've nothing to compare it with other than the spreadsheet based system. However, my first reactions to it are very positive, with a few minor glitches.<br>
<br>
Testlink works on the PHP/MySQL platform (and other databases), so, after downloading from Sourceforge, I installed it on my local test web server. Users of the <a href="http://www.etomite.org/">Etomite</a> content management system will recognise the install screens. They walk you through the process of setting up the link to the database and pick up any potential sources of problems in your PC configuration.<br>
<br>
Once you're in as administrator you first have to create a Test Project. This is the container for all the testing activity for a particular project. Each Test Project is independent, and users can have different roles within different projects. You can also create new roles and give them specific permissions.<br>
<br>
Then it's on to adding your Requirements (optional), which can be imported from a CSV file (as can many of the other data elements, eg. Test Cases).<br>
<br>
Once the Requirements are in, you start building a Test Specification, with Test Cases, grouped into Test Suites.<br>
<br>
Then you hand it over to your Testers to execute the Tests, record their results and add evidence.<br>
<br>
At any stage you can run off a full range of reports, in HTML, OpenOffice and MS Word formats.<br>
<br>
So, it's all looking good. What are the glitches?<br>
<br>
As a system, Testlink is pretty intuitive, as long as you know something about Test processes. Without that you'll be reliant on the documentation. This is thorough and detailed, but reflects the multi-national nature of the Testlink development team. At some points the English used could be clearer. But that's a minor glitch - easily fixed by someone with the time to improve it.<br>
<br>
The only other problem is actually implementing the software. The advantage of spreadsheets is that they can be distributed and collected through normal, email-based, channels.<br>
<br>
To get people using any system like Testlink will mean getting approval for a server, setting up the server and any associated firewall ports, adding all the users, and setting up appropriate roles and permissions. All of those aspects need maintenance, particularly if your userbase is flexible and changes frequently.<br>
<br>
If you can overcome the implementation problem, then a system like Testlink would be a valuable addition to any team that has a lot of testing to do.</div><h1>If I was Secretary of State for Education ....</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 November 2009</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Not that that's likely, since I like my independence too much to be tied to a party line!<br>
<br>
But, if I was Secretary of State for Education, or Schools Minister, or whatever the current title was, I would do the following (<em>Edit following feedback</em>: Items 2 &amp; 3 are a bit techy, after that it gets onto the more educational, political and managerial stuff):<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Rebuild the professionalism that teachers have given up and had taken from them over the past twenty years - by requiring the <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/">General Teaching Council</a> to adopt continuing professional development regimes similar to other professions, such as <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/continuing_professional_development/cpd_guidance.asp">doctors</a>, <a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/cpd.page">solicitors</a> and <a href="http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/features/2040447/cpd-institute-chartered-accountants-england-wales">accountants</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Allow teachers to spend more time on their own professional development rather than writing out planning documents - by encouraging the development and use of ICT-based planning tools (such as <a href="http://www.skillsfactory.co.uk/">Skillsfactory</a>). This would be achieved through government promoting an XML machine readable standard for curriculum documentation, including the National Curriculum and QCA schemes of work, but also to include curricula and schemes of work from other publishers, who may even be individual schools or teachers.</li><br>
  <li>Adopt the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_backup">Moodle XML backup</a> format as a required standard for the transfer of information between online Learning Platforms. This would then take the focus away from <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM</a>, encourage much richer online educational experiences and allow publishers and teachers to really explore what online learning can mean.</li><br>
  <li>Immediately remove the SATS tests at Y2 and Y6, thus taking away the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/07/24/open-letter-to-ed-balls-secretary-of-sta?blog=5">skewing affect these currently have on our children's education</a>. They would be replaced by an ongoing, long-term, sample-based research project designed to investigate the state of education within our primary schools.</li><br>
  <li>Immediately remove the concept of school league tables, which encourage an unhelpful climate of competition between schools, and instead require schools to demonstrate cooperation with other schools, through, for example, shared management, shared facilities management, shared teachers, and shared facilities.</li><br>
  <li>Minimise government interference in how schools are run, how teaching takes place, and what children learn. There is no one-size-fits-all in education. Instead, allow gifted, creative teachers to use their specialisms within a broad framework (such as that already proposed by the <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/primarycurriculumreview/">Rose Review</a>), but without the micro-managed detail of content to be studied or methods to use. Allow children to learn at their own pace, without the target mentality that plagues our classrooms. And allow management teams to work out how best to support learning in their community. This level of responsibility <strong>must</strong> come with accountability. As in the best private sector organisations with devolved management: decisions need to be justified, based on evidence; mistakes owned up to quickly and lessons learned should be shared. There is a role here for OFSTED, different to its current role which often demoralises teachers and creates vast amounts of unnecessary paperwork.</li><br>
  <li>Make teachers' pay increases dependent on evidence of reflective professional development, subject to a minumum inflation-rate increase.</li><br>
  <li>Allow schools to use the money saved through sharing facilities, teachers, facilities management and school management, to fund more people working directly with children in order to increase the adult-child ratio.</li><br>
  <li>Reduce the gap (both financial and perceptual) between teachers and teaching assistants by putting them on the same, extended, pay scale. Teachers will be expected to treat their support staff as valuable help in the classroom, who often have greater specific expertise than the teacher in charge of that lesson. Movement through the pay scale will depend on evidence of professional development and responsibilities taken on.</li><br>
  <li>Work on the realistic assumption that most teachers work extensively during school holidays and at weekends and build this into the working week by spreading out the holidays so that the breaks are more regular but shorter.</li><br>

<br>
I'm now going to start to unpack those a little. As always, I'm open for feedback and discussion - otherwise I'm just thinking in a little bubble of my own!<br>
<br>
<blockquote>1) Rebuild the professionalism that teachers have given up and had taken from them over the past twenty years - by requiring the <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/">General Teaching Council</a> to adopt continuing professional development regimes similar to other professions, such as <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/continuing_professional_development/cpd_guidance.asp">doctors</a>, <a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/cpd.page">solicitors</a> and <a href="http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/features/2040447/cpd-institute-chartered-accountants-england-wales">accountants</a>.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Teaching has, historically, been seen as a profession - "a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation" (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profession">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a>).<br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession">Wikipedia currently (1st Nov 2009) describes some of the characteristics of a profession</a> as:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Having knowledge</li><br>
  <li>Being self-regulated</li><br>
  <li>Having autonomy</li><br>
  <li>Having status and prestige</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The UK Government reforms of education the 1980's (particularly the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880040_en_1">Education Reform Act of 1987</a>) had a "profound effect on the way education is delivered in England" (Leaton Gray 2007). In particular, it resulted in teachers becoming technicians following processes under a strong top-down management system. Rather than reforming the profession to encourage it to raise its own standards, instead the government took control and began to micro-manage teaching, right down to the classroom. This started with the Conservative government of the time, and continued with Tony Blair's Labour government; especially with the introduction of the <a href="http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/">National Strategies</a>.<br>
<br>
Many other countries (eg. USA and New Zealand) followed similar routes in their education systems, whilst others, such as Finland, went in a totally different direction - that of "teacher empowerment" (Webb 2004). There is now evidence to suggest that the approach taken in the UK and elsewhere has reduced levels of motivation, efficacy, commitment, job satisfaction and effectiveness (Day 2002), and also creativity (Robinson 2006).<br>
<br>
It could be argued that the reforms were the result of many years during which teachers revelled in their autonomy, but without the self-regulation and ongoing learning required of a true profession. Pockets of excellence across the country did not lead to the wholesale improvements in "standards" (or at least those standards that could be easily measured).<br>
<br>
This is in contrast to the other professions: doctors, lawyers, accountants etc. These have a long history of self-regulation, the setting of professional standards, and of ongoing professional development. Whilst these three professions all have to work within a government-regulated environment, there is not the level of micro-management that has led to teachers losing their professional identities.<br>
<br>
I would propose that the <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/">General Teaching Council</a>, being the licensing body for teachers, makes reflective, ongoing professional development a requirement of continuing as a licensed teacher. Instead of just being the body that strikes people off for bad practice, it would become the body that promotes good practice. Every teacher should have a professional development record, to be submitted annually in order to maintain their ability to practice as a teacher.<br>
<br>
Just that one step would make a huge difference. However, it would mean extra work for each teacher. In the current de-professionalised climate, that would not go down well with the unions. And rightly so. It must be matched with other initiatives that are designed to reduce the teacher workload. Looking back at my time as a teacher, and talking with friends and colleagues who still work in schools, there are four main tasks you do as a teacher:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Plan what you're going to do with the children</li><br>
  <li>Work with children in the classroom</li><br>
  <li>Assess what the children have done</li><br>
  <li>Engage with parents and other parties about their children's progress</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
All are equally important, yet the planning often takes up an inordinate amount of time, simply to comply with government guidance and perceptions of what OFSTED requires.<br>
<br>
If there was some way to reduce the paperwork, perhaps teachers would be more inclined to focus more on their own professional development.<br>
<br>
That will be the subject of next week's post. <br>

<br>
Jane is a very effective advocate of <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a>, the open source social networking and social publishing platform. She calls it a social-learning platform, and uses it as the base from which a whole load of activities are started, and to introduce the concepts involved in social learning.<br>
<br>
As I came home, I was pondering whether I would use Elgg for this purpose, or whether I'd use <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>. It's a tricky one, because whichever platform you use, you will be using it for two different purposes:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Formal, directed learning activities</li><br>
  <li>Providing a space to explore informal, learner-led activities</li><br>
</ol><br>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Informal, directed learning activities</strong></td>
<td><br>
<p>Great for the tutor. Easy to setup standard sets of activities and to switch them on over the course of the programme. Easy to administer large groups of learners.</p><br>
<p>Designed to support <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Philosophy" title="Moodle Philosophy">social-constructivist approaches to learning</a> in formal education settings. Excellent discussion forum capabilities.</p><br>
<p>Creating multipage web resources only possible with the additional <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Book_module">"Book" module</a>.</p><br>
</td>
<td><p>Administering users and adding them to groups looks like a manual process for each user.</p><br>
<p>Lots of functionality available to the learner from the start. Can be confusing to know what to do first.</p><br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Providing a space to explore informal, learner-led activities</strong></td>
<td><br>
<p>Moodle can do the social-network stuff, but it takes some digging and a fair bit of work for the administrator. For example, each user's name is a link to their profile which then gives you access to other things they've posted. But it's not easy to find things on the same or similar topics. There are also other modules that you can add to provide additional facilities.</p><br>
<p>No user upload of files for sharing - without additional modules (See: <a href="http://transparentlearning.blogspot.com/2008/06/moodle-and-social-networking.html">Moodle and Social Networking</a>)</p><br>
<br>
</td>
<td><br>
<p>The Elgg interface is based around the individual and building their network. So it's ideal for this purpose.</p><br>
<p>Links between people, files, posts etc are made explicit through a consistent tag engine. This can be confusing to navigate at first, but for the expert user group can be extremely powerful.</p><br>
</td>

<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
In today's instance, with the opportunity for an initial face-to-face workshop to iron out niggles with the Elgg interface, I think I would have chosen Elgg, as Jane did.<br>
<br>
If the programme had started online, I think I would have started with Moodle as it's much easier to move things on gently (following Gilly Salmon's five stage model), and then expanded out with Elgg or perhaps <a href="http://mahara.org/">Mahara</a>, which integrates with Moodle.<br>

<br>
http://c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/markberthelemy.html<br>
<br>
Caveat: My role changes rapidly depending very much on the project(s) I'm working on. This set of tools reflects the one I'm using most at the moment.<br>
 <br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Still <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a>, but <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome">Chrome</a> is a close second. My browser, as well as being a research tool is where I run applications, and troubleshoot designs. It needs to be standards compliant (ie. not IE) and have tools within it that help with the design process. Which leads on to my second tool...</li><br>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">Firefox Web Developer Toolbar</a>, is an addon to Firefox that is indispensible for sorting out problems with HTML and CSS. Especially important with complex applications like Moodle which has multiple, nested CSS files.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>, still the engine that I use to power my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/">Learning Conversations</a> blog. It's immensely powerful, especially so if you want multi-user and multi-blog systems - far easier to set up than <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">Wordpress MU</a>. However, for what I and most people need, actually my next tool is probably more suited.</li><br>
  <li><a href="file:///Users/markberthelemy/Google%20Drive/R&amp;D/LearningConversations/wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has a superb user interface. It's very easy to skin and is flexible enough to be the underlying application for most content-based websites. The menuing system, in particular, is a joy to use (compared to <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, which is extremely powerful but complex for the end user - the site administrator).</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> - still my collection point for RSS feeds. I haven't found anything better, and I'll certainly never go back to a client-based system. The browser wins again!</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.googlemail.com/">Googlemail</a>. I've moved away from Apple Mail, as I could never get hold of my emails when I was on the move. Googlemail lets me collect all my email accounts in one place. Search is great, and so is the filtering and filing system. It's only let down by its inability to sort by anything.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. I've only got into this issue tracking and project tool recently. It's used by the Moodle development team, and we're also using on other projects. It's excellent for managing distributed teams, whilst keeping all the project information in one place.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq mockups</a>. If you need to discuss with your client how a site or application will be laid out on the screen, and how the navigation will work, you don't want to be wasting time on colour schemes. Balsamiq mockups gives you a way of creating mockups that look hand-drawn. Allowing you to focus on the important stuff.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>. I can't get away from it. Moodle is just well featured and designed around the needs of the teacher. Yes, it's a little clunky in places - but I'll tell you, I've seen far worse! The thing I really like about it is the way it's so easy to integrate with other systems.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/default.aspx">Visio</a>. My toolkit will always include some means of providing visual representations of complex ideas. That could be <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx">Powerpoint</a>, <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/">Mind Manager</a>, <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind</a>, <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/">CmapTools</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> etc. Each tool is best for a slightly different context and purpose. The one I'm finding myself drawn to more often at the moment (because I'm having to think a lot about processes) is Visio. It's way more powerful than I'm ever going to need, but I haven't got anything better to use as a quick way of producing diagrams and flow charts.</li><br>
 </ol></div><h1>Reducing teacher workload</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/11/01/rebuilding-teacher-professionalism?blog=5">Last week's post</a> in this series on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/c36/ed-reform/?blog=5">Education Reform</a> discussed the pressing need for teachers to rebuild teaching as a profession. A key element in this rebuilding programme would be a requirement for teachers to undertake ongoing, reflective, professional development in order to remain licensed as teachers.<br>
<br>
Such an initiative cannot happen without the goodwill of teachers. They must see that a) it will be good for them as individuals and b) not add to their already considerable workload.<br>
<br>
Good professional development <strong>does</strong> take time. There are no short cuts to learning. So, where can government help to reduce workload in order to allow time for learning?<br>
<br>
<h3>Reduce the paperwork</h3><br>
<br>
Talk to most teachers in England (NB, Wales and Scotland already have different, reforming regimes) about what would make the biggest improvement to their professional lives and they will say “reduce the paperwork”.<br>
<br>
What they're talking about is the termly, weekly and daily documentation required by schools as an audit trail. It proves that they are covering all the criteria and objectives required by the school's policies and government initiatives, and provides evidence that children are achieving as (or more than) expected.<br>
<br>
It's difficult to argue against the need for such documentation. From the teacher's point of view it should help them to plan, carry out and evaluate their work effectively. From the child's point of view it should mean they end up with learning activities that are tailored to them as an individual. From the school's point of view it means they have evidence to show to OfSTED when they come calling.<br>
<br>
What is difficult to argue is the scale of the task...<br>
<br>
<h3>What paperwork?</h3><br>
<br>
Most teachers have to prepare at least three sets of documents:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Termly planning which provides an overview of what will be covered and when.</li><br>
  <li>Weekly planning which looks at the week ahead as a whole showing how the different lessons will fit together, and where the objectives set in the termly plan will be covered.</li><br>
  <li>Daily planning which looks at each lesson during the day, documenting, in detail, how the objectives will be met.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
At its simplest, each time a teacher sits down to plan, they will need to consider a range of local and national frameworks and policies, which may include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>national strategy framework for the subject under consideration</li><br>
  <li>national curriculum</li><br>
  <li>cross-curricular dimensions</li><br>
  <li>QCA scheme of work or local scheme of work</li><br>
  <li>individual education plans for children in their class with special needs</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The relevant sections of these documents have to be recorded within the planning.<br>
<br>
They then have to match up the disparate framework objectives with the children in their class, and plan a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction">differentiated</a> activities for that lesson that will allow each child to reach their potential for that objective. They also have to indicate how they will assess against each objective.<br>
<br>
And each subject often has its own separate planning form! eg. <a href="http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/node/46705">the Maths example from National Strategies</a><br>
<br>
For examples of the types of planning forms teachers have to fill in see the links below:<br>

<a href="http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/node/97678">National Strategies lesson plan outline</a><br>
<a href="http://schools.northyorks.gov.uk/get.html?_Action=GetFile&amp;_Key=Data12791&amp;_Id=687&amp;_Wizard=0&amp;_DontCache=1234803679">Medium term planning template (for Science) - North Yorks County Council</a><br>
<a href="http://www.johndavies.notts.sch.uk/curriculum/long.htm">Long term plan example - John Davies Primary School</a><br>
<br>
After the lesson the teacher then has to indicate how each child has achieved against the objectives, evaluate their own performance and whether the activities worked as planned.<br>
<br>
All this has to be done for each lesson, for every day. Of course, the teacher also has to research and prepare resources, mark work, deal with queries from parents, help individual children, manage their teaching assistants, and deal with all the minutiae that children can bring to school.<br>
<br>
<h3>What about PPA time?</h3><br>
<br>
The Planning, Preparation and Assessment time brought in by the current government, guarantees a minimum of 10 per cent of their timetabled teaching commitment to be used for planning, preparation and assessment. In practice this works out at about a half day every other week. Considering that teachers work, <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/research/policyarchive/workforceremodelling/workloadstudy/">on average, 52 hours per week during term time</a> (and most, in my experience, also work during school holidays), this actually makes very little dent in the planning time required for most teachers.<br>
<br>
Documenting planning <em>can</em> become less of an issue in larger and particularly secondary schools. Economies of scale mean that workload can be shared, and there tends to be more flexibility in timetabling to allow planning to take place within the school day.<br>
<br>
Those most affected by this planning problem are in primary schools and particularly schools where one teacher has responsibility for one or more whole year groups.<br>
<br>
<h3>How do they do it?</h3><br>
<br>
The process most schools have adopted to generate all this documentation is extremely manual. In many cases, it's all written out in long-hand, with objectives copied into each document where needed, and then copied across into the more detailed planning.<br>
<br>
More enlightened (and IT-confident) teachers will use a word-processor, but there's still vast amounts of copying and pasting to be done.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2009/09/11/an-introduction-to-using-google-calendar-for-timetables-and-meetings/">Some schools</a> have adopted generic technologies such as Google Apps to assist their planning processes.<br>
<br>
A growing number are also using ICT tools that are specifically designed to aid planning. (eg. the excellent <a href="http://www.skillsfactory.co.uk/">Skillsfactory</a>). The best of these will allow collaborative editing, sharing of planning, drilling down into the planning, and reuse of data.<br>
<br>
Given the massive difference these tools make to those teachers that use them, it's amazing how little press is given to them from the unions and from government.<br>
<br>
<h3>The government's role</h3><br>
<br>
Government intervention in school software markets has to date been about setting functionality standards (eg. Learning Platforms), or about providing financial incentives (eg. Curriculum online). Neither have worked particularly well.<br>
<br>
The process of setting national functionality standards is always a long one, and therefore always lags behind what is technically possible. This tends to lead to a slow down in innovation.<br>
<br>
Financial incentives become seen as a cash cow for the software providers who then invest heavily in their sales and marketing. The schools see the ring-fenced funding as just money that has to be spent, and often take less care than they should in deciding a) what it should be spent on and b) any change management that would need to take place to take full advantage of the software.<br>
<br>
There are a two ways that government could stimulate take-up (and further development) of teacher planning tools:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Develop a standard, machine-readable (ie. XML) way of describing curriculum objectives, that could be used by all nationally-produced curriculum frameworks. It would be similar to, even be based on, the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/metadata/">IMS learning object metadata standard</a>. With frameworks published using such a standard, the software suppliers would be able to focus their time on creating software that's useful for teachers rather than each of them trying to maintain the frameworks in their own system. Schools, local authorities or publishers could also create their own curriculum frameworks using this standard, which could then be used within the planning tool.</li><br>
<li>Provide funding for teacher professional development that is dependant on the school showing how it has reduced the teacher planning workload (which may or may not be through the use of ICT).</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
With these two initiatives in place, we would then expect to see more innovation in the planning tool market, and also an increase in the levels of professional development taken up by teachers.<br>
<br>
There will be more discussion on professional development when I get to point 7 of my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/10/25/if-i-was-secretary-of-state-for-educatio?blog=5">manifesto for education reform</a>. Next week, however, I'll move onto looking at the use of online learning within (and without!) school.<br>

George Siemens is <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=192">discussing whether the future of learning is in Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Social Networking Systems</a>.</p><br>
<p>In his post, George describes Moodle as being one of many "content-centric" systems. Martin Dougiamas (founder of Moodle) then comments:</p><br>
<blockquote><br>
<p>Moodle itself is actually activity-centric. Facilitators using Moodle start with an empty course container and use a handy collection of tools/apps/modules to build a collection or series of focussed collaborative activities for a group of people. Through roles, these same capabilities can be provided to any user (eg students) in the system. Moodle itself is fairly neutral pedagogically – most things are possible.</p><br>
<p>...</p><br>
<p>However, I strongly agree that a large proportion of Moodle administrators and teachers don’t necessarily understand all this, and end up USING the system in a very didactic and locked-down way, reducing write capabilities and focussing on “dump and pump” learning designs (resources and quizzes). I do understand some of the reasons – many of them have never had the exciting online learning experiences we know are possible, or are constrained by very outdated brick-and-mortar policies at their institutions.</p><br>
</blockquote><br>
<p>Based on Martin's explanation, actually where Moodle differs from network-based systems like Elgg, is that Moodle is <strong>teacher-centric</strong>, whereas Elgg &amp; co are <strong>learner-centric</strong>. Both have their place. It depends on who is deciding what is to be learnt, and on the <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">confidence of the learner to learn</a>.</p><br>
<p>I will admit, I'm just as guilty of creating locked down learning systems with "dump and pump" learning designs, and using Moodle to do so - knowing full well that we're only using a tiny proportion of its capabilities. But there are often very good reasons.</p><br>
<p>The primary reason to adopt content-centric approaches is that good, <a href="http://dougiamas.com/writing/constructivism.html">constructivist</a> online learning takes time. If you follow Gilly Salmon's excellent, practical <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">5 stage model</a>, you can easily be talking about at least 3-4 weeks before meaningful learning takes place - particularly if you're dealing with part-time learners. Yes, we know that this type of learning is long-lasting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)#Research_and_evidence_supporting_constructivism">far more effective</a> than behaviourist or cognitivist approaches, but most purchasers of learning services would baulk at the cost of it. Constructivist approaches do not scale at all well, whereas content-centric approaches do - thus making them far more attractive to the purchaser.</p><br>
<p>The secondary reason is about why we use Moodle. It's just so easy to maintain, to adapt and to integrate. The code is perhaps not ideal for computer-science purists, but it's written pragmatically - making it easy to work with. Moodle's also such a stable platform. The size of the development community helps here. It gives corporate IT departments confidence.</p><br>
<p>So Moodle's a good choice from an IT perspective, but perhaps not always the best choice from the corporate learning perspective.</p><br>
<p>It's a fantastic tool in the hands of a skilled online facilitator. Yet, circumstances dictate that it's often used inappropriately. Many times that is simply because the people buying the service just don't realise the potential and capabilities of online, constructivist learning approaches.</p><br>
<p>Elgg, similarly, is a fantastic tool when used with a community of motivated and skilled learners. However, trying &nbsp;to persuade those who hold the purse strings that Elgg will help them deliver their compliance training etc is almost impossible.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps we need a halfway house. A system that:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>allows <strong>organisations </strong>to <strong>push </strong><strong>content </strong>to all or groups of their learners - learning from Amazon's marketing model</li><br>
<li>allows <strong>learners </strong>to <strong>connect with other learners </strong>in similar situations and with similar needs</li><br>
<li>allows <strong>learners</strong> to <strong>select content</strong> based on ratings, recommendations and what their network is doing</li><br>
<li>allows <strong>tutors/trainers</strong> to provide a sense of direction, synthesise ideas, coach...</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>If your organisation is content-centric, then give them content <strong>plus</strong> connections. Show them Amazon. That way you'll start to pull them towards a more learner-centric approach to learning.</p><br>
<p>To be honest, I can't see how we will ever get corporate training departments to adopt constructivist approaches. Perhaps we're just asking too much. Although Moodle does work in corporate training, is it really the best fit?</p><br>

I saw this working <a href="file:///main/index.php/2009/02/09/involve-by-infinity-learning?blog=5">earlier this year</a>, and got quite excited by it. Its main downfall, for me, was that it treats SCORM-based content completely separately from other types of content (eg. documents, mp3's etc). It gives far greater prominence to the SCORM packages in the navigation system, where really there should be no difference between how they are presented to the learner.</p><br>
<p>During a search on "Learning ecosystems" last week, in preparation for the Learning Technologies session, I came across <a href="http://wisetail.com/solutions.php">Wisetail's Learning Ecosystem</a>. Subsequently, I spent an extremely useful hour with Justin Bigart, the company's founder, taking me through the background to the system and how it works in practice.</p><br>
<p>The companies that Wisetail tend to work with are young;&nbsp;full of people who are used to telling their stories online - through Facebook, blogs, Youtube etc. They expect to be in control of their learning, and expect to gain recognition through what they do.</p><br>
<p>Wisetail works by providing a software tool (the Learning Ecosystem) that combines the engagement qualities of Facebook with the top-down management and reporting abilities of an LMS. Alongside this, they have a media team that uses storytelling techniques to produce videos which sit inside the Learning Ecosystem. The aim is to help the clients develop their own media skills so they can tell their own stories.</p><br>
<p>As well as videos, the Ecosystem can handle any file format. Currently it only really works with single files or embedding content hosted externally. So, there's no simple way to upload &nbsp;the output of <a href="http://www.articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, <a href="http://exelearning.org/">ExeLearning</a> or any of the host of rapid development tools that create HTML and Flash-based content. However, given its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modular architecture</a>, Justin reassured me that this could be added if a client needed it.</p><br>
<p>The exciting bit happens when you see how learners access the content (known as modules).</p><br>
<p>Every module has a points value attached to it. Learners collect points when they access a module. Some clients are using these like loyalty points to exchange for incentives.</p><br>
<p>How people are using the modules is completely transparent. Every learner can see who else has used the module, can see how many points they've collected, how many times they've logged in and which modules they've commented on. As well as using a bit of peer pressure psychology to incentivise usage, this also is seen to celebrate the community and storytelling.</p><br>
<p>The criticial thing seems to be that this tool currently works best in organisations that already have a devolved culture of expertise, trust and expectation of sharing. It would take a lot of change management work to implement this inside a typical, tightly controlled corporation or civil service agency.</p><br>
<p>For Wisetail to crack these markets, they would need to provide some level of SCORM capability. Not because SCORM has any value in this context (See: <a href="file:///main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM Warning</a>), but because those responsible for procurement have been convinced that they must ask for SCORM (often without knowing why). On the other hand, it might be better for Wisetail to ignore SCORM completely, as then they would have to then produce functionality to deliver meaningless activity reports to managers. The type of learning culture that is supported by the Learning Ecosystem is diametrically opposed to the one that goes alongside your typical Learning Management System.</p><br>
<p>Would I recommend Wisetail's Learning Ecosystem?</p><br>
<p>Given what I've seen of the company, their software development methods, and the product, I'd say, "Yes, but..."</p><br>
<p>Be aware that the software you choose must reflect the culture of the organisation. Take a look at my <a href="file:///main/index.php/2009/02/23/ten-tips-for-choosing-using-social?blog=5">Top Tips for Choosing and Using Social Software</a>. If the culture's not already there, but it's where you want to be, then also be aware that some change management will be required.</p></div><h1>Getting started with social software for learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 January 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The world of social software is large, diverse and complex. There are a multitude of applications that sit within this space. Some of these are single purpose applications, such as Twitter, Wordpress, Google Docs, Google Reader etc. Some are multi-purpose, such as Facebook, Elgg and Moodle.<br>
<br>
This post is not about how to choose the right application. I wrote about that earlier this year (<a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/02/23/ten-tips-for-choosing-using-social?blog=5">Top tips for choosing and using social software</a>), and Jane Hart's <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html">directory of software</a> is probably the most useful starting place.<br>
<br>
Instead, this post is about how to start making use of social software to support learning.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming that you have some responsibility for leading learning (whatever that means) in an organisation. It could be a corporate learning &amp; development department, a Higher Education institution, a commercial training company or a school.<br>
<br>
You've recognised the value that the social element brings to learning. Probably through reading papers or books from the leading thinkers in this field such as <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/">George Siemens</a> (<a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm">Connectivism</a>), <a href="http://www.ewenger.com/">Etienne Wenger</a> (<a href="http://www.ewenger.com/theory/index.htm">Communities of Practice</a>), and <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> (<a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/31741">Elearning 2.0</a>).<br>
<br>
You've now been charged with introducing these ideas into your organisation. Probably as a pilot project, with a small group of people.<br>
<br>
Where do you start? Where are the pitfalls to watch out for? What will help or hinder you?<br>
<br>
<h3>Start with the person</h3><br>
<br>
Most social software projects start with the aim of encouraging creativity, knowledge sharing and collaboration.<br>
<br>
This is to be achieved by providing tools that allow people to make connections with each other, collaborate on work and share knowledge.<br>
<br>
Often, very little thought is given to how those tools will actually be used, how the individuals concerned will learn how to use them, what motivation they will have to use them, and how that motivation will be sustained.<br>
<br>
For successful social learning projects we must remember that we're dealing with people, with needs, desires, other priorities, and varying levels of confidence.<br>
<br>
Social learning starts with the individual. It's the individual who chooses to contribute. It's the individual who learns. It's the individual who makes connections to other individuals. Only then, through those connections can the group, the organisation, learn and change.<br>
<br>
So, rather than immediately putting people into a collaborative environment, expecting them to create knowledge together, my recommendation would always be to take it steady, and start with demonstrating the usefulness of social learning to the individual. Of course, if you're working with a group that is already motivated to generate knowledge collaboratively, then you can bypass a lot of this.<br>
<br>
<h3>It's all about syndication</h3><br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS (Really Simple Syndication)</a> is the glue that holds individuals together on the web. It's the means by which I can write a blog post and get a comment on it a few minutes later. It's the means by which I can read the content from dozens of websites without having to waste time physically going to the site. Instead of having to have everyone inside one giant system, like Facebook, RSS allows each individual to have their own personal space, working just as they want it to, yet still be connected to other people.<br>
<br>
Think of RSS as just like the way cartoonists syndicate their work to newspapers. Every time they create a new cartoon, they put it in a central place from which those subscribing newspapers pick it up to republish in their pages.<br>
<br>
When I write a post here, it goes into a pot (my RSS feed). All those people who have chosen to subscribe to my feed have software which regularly checks to see if there's anything new in the feed. If there is, their software takes the content of the feed and publishes it in that person's feedreader.<br>
<br>
So, my starting place would be to encourage the learners you work with to:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Find one or two people who are writing regular blogs in your field (use Google's <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Blog Search</a> if you don't know any, even better ask someone you trust to recommend blogs to you)</li><br>
<li>Subscribe to their RSS feeds in a feed reader. There are many of these. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, as it's web-based. I can then keep up with my feeds from any internet-connected computer.</li><br>
</ul> <br>
<br>
As you read people's blogs, they will link to other people, who you may also wish to subscribe to. Over time that list of subscriptions will change, as your interests and priorities change. It may sometimes need pruning, or even starting again. What you're doing is building up a trusted network from whom you can learn.<br>
<br>
This learning network can include many types of content:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Text-based blogs</li><br>
<li>Presentations (eg. on Slideshare)</li><br>
<li>Video (eg. on Youtube)</li><br>
<li>Audio podcasts</li><br>
<li>Job adverts</li><br>
<li>etc</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
You don't just have to subscribe to an individual person's feed. Many of these sites provide feeds for content that has been categorised or tagged in a particular way. Some let you create personal searches that then deliver an RSS feed. You can even set up a Google blog or news search that delivers an RSS feed everytime something new appears in the search results.<br>
<br>
The feed reader allows you to quickly scan, and then sort content for stuff that is then relevant to you. It becomes the starting point for your Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system. Harold Jarche is a well-known advocate of the concept of the PKM and has a series of excellent posts that describe his particular way of working.<br>
<br>
<h3>Start to contribute</h3><br>
<br>
Most people that put their knowledge "out there" do so for one or more of these reasons:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>To synthesise and crystallise their own thoughts</li><br>
<li>To gain feedback on their thoughts, thus refining them</li><br>
<li>To share knowledge in the expectation/hope that it will help other people</li><br>
<li>To prove a level of expertise in a subject</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Most allow people to provide feedback through the use of comments on the content. For this you have to actually go to item in question and add your comment in a box below the content. By doing so you are then contributing to the original author's understanding of the content. You might provide negative feedback, which may challenge their thinking. This happened to me recently. Just take a look at the comments on my post on Education Reform. Or you might provide positive feedback which reaffirms their thinking. Or you may just respond with a question which would encourage them to clarify and re-explain.<br>
<br>
Taking part in this conversation is just like being at a conference with strangers. You start off as the new person in the room. Over time, listening in to different conversations you gradually get a feel for how the group talks about things. You learn the language. You get to know who the characters are, and the experts to whom others are listening and referring. Eventually you gain enough confidence to ask a question within the group, or even posit your own opinion. It's a big step, but an important one. It's at that point that you will then start moving from being on the periphery to moving towards the centre.<br>
<br>
<h3>Your knowledge is important</h3><br>
<br>
Having gained the confidence to participate in the community of practice, I would then encourage my learners to create their own space in which they can synthesise, gain feedback, share knowledge and prove expertise. Initially the primary motivation for this is likely to simply be to have a central space for keeping the ideas they are learning about.<br>
<br>
That could just be a set of annotated bookmarks (using, for example, Diigo or Delicious), but it may need to develop into a personal learning journal (aka blog) - perhaps hosted on Blogger, Edublogs or Wordpress.com, or on their own server (my choice) or on their organisation's servers. The latter would be my least preferred option, as then the blog becomes seen as part of the organisation rather than something that's of benefit for the individual.<br>
<br>
How you use your blog is up to you. Initially mine began as a place to store links to other sites, particularly ones which I thought my colleagues would find useful. It has now developed into the place where I continually reflect on what I'm learning and try to crystallise those thoughts into writing that will be of use to other people. Having a product and an audience to aim for is essential for my own learning process.<br>
<br>
<h3>Maintaining connections and collaborating</h3><br>
<br>
Having your own online space means that other people in your community of practice then have a place to link to. You become an integral part of the network.<br>
<br>
The aim of all Connectivist learning activity is to maintain those links, to ensure that the knowledge you receive and create is current and relevant. Connections will diminish or increase in importance. Your community of practice may change over time as your own expertise develops and needs different types of input.<br>
<br>
To maintain your connections it's important to:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Regularly prune, organise and sort your feeds - the people you read, watch or listen to</li><br>
<li>Continually reflect on what you're learning and put those reflections into the community for comment and further refinement</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Communities of practice with strong links are ideally placed to undertake collaborative activities. It is these communities that have the motivation to create products of their shared knowledge.<br>
<br>
The educational technology community provides many excellent examples of collaboration in practice. For example, Vicki Davis and many other teachers collaborated on a <a href="http://docs.google.com/present/view?fs=true&amp;id=ah4zsdj46b66_578cv4x7#">presentation about using Google's Presentation tool in the classroom</a>. She then reflected on it on her blog post: <a href="http://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/2007/09/and-walls-came-down.html">And the walls came down</a>.<br>
<br>
Also take a look at Doug Belshaw's <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2009/10/14/where-were-headed-with-the-academys-e-learning-ecosystem/">post about the "Learning Ecosystem"</a> at his new school.<br>
<br>
You may find that you can jump straight to online collaboration if you already have a strong face-to-face community of practice, defined by Wenger as:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Most groups of people do not have the confidence in their own knowledge, in their peers, and in the software tools to be able to leap to this step. It takes a lot to be able to add your own ideas to someone else's work, and even more to take someone else's words and change them. Our whole culture of education is currently predicated on each individual producing work that is then critiqued by an expert. We are not encouraged to think of ourselves as experts, on an equal footing with our peers.<br>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
<br>
Collaborative learning requires both the "teacher" and the "learner" to take very different roles from that which they're used to. Such culture change takes time, patience and lots and lots of gentle encouragement.<br>
<br>
There will be set backs. Many of them will be related to the ease of use (or not) of the software tools, and many will be caused by lack of motivation and confidence. Getting those sorted at the beginning of the project are essential for success. It's the first building block in Gilly Salmon's Five Stage Model for computer mediated communication, and rightly so.<br>
<br>
I hope this post has been useful. It's based on personal experience. Your experiences may be very different. I'd love to hear about them.<br>

<p>Clive Shepherd's recent post on "<a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2009/11/exploring-e-learning-in-all-its-forms.html">Elearning in all its forms</a>" gives an overview of the three main facets of elearning and how they can each be used across the spectrum of informal to formal learning. I've repackaged Clive's ideas into a table which tries to show the full spectrum:</p><br>

</table><br>
<p>The social learning tools, whether they are synchronous (at the same time) or asynchronous (at different times), are all about the interactions and communication between people. These are an essential component of any learning ecosystem.</p><br>
<p><a href="http://eduspaces.net/terrya/weblog/">Terry Anderson</a> (Professor in Distance Education - Athabasca University), describes the main interactions that take place within any learning context as:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Student &lt;-&gt; Teacher</li><br>
<li>Student &lt;-&gt; Student</li><br>
<li>Student &lt;-&gt; Content</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>This is illustrated in the model of online learning diagram below (taken from page 61 of <a href="http://www.aupress.ca/books/120146/ebook/99Z_Anderson_2008-Theory_and_Practice_of_Online_Learning.pdf">Theory and Practice of Online Learning (2nd edition), Ed. Terry Anderson, Athabasca Publishing, free pdf download</a>)</p><br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/model_online_learning.png"><img src="./assets/model_online_learning.png" alt="" width="500"></a></div><br>
<p>Even in the most locked down training environment, such as compliance training (although I'm with <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2007/10/complaince-killing-training.html">Donald Clark</a> here on questioning its effectiveness) there is a social element. We cannot prevent people talking to each other, from finding out how that particular community of practice really does things. Just see Etienne Wenger's <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/excerpted_from_wenger.htm">vignette of a claims processing office</a> to see that happening. If a trainer thinks that they are the sole source of information or the sole means of changing behaviour, then, I'm afraid, they are delusional.</p><br>
<p>So, how should managers/trainers incorporate social learning into the formal learning agenda of the organisation?</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>Accept that social learning will happen. With or without your permission.</li><br>
<li>Realise that, as a manager/trainer, you are in the selling and persuading business. You need to market your changes otherwise they will be subverted or even ignored.</li><br>
<li>Ensure that you have a communications strategy (NB. Not a learning strategy) for every change you need to push through. If you have a learning strategy it then assumes that every problem is answered by training.</li><br>
<li>Create or allow open communication channels for your employees to use to request help, suggest ideas and to provide feedback. Forums are the most obvious, but some organisations may use blogs, video sharing etc.</li><br>
<li>Ensure those channels allow two-way employee to employee communication</li><br>
<li>Monitor those channels, not censor</li><br>
<li>Use the feedback to make changes to your communications and to the ideas you are wanting to push through</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>Would that work in your organisation?</p></div><h1>Open letter to trainingspotting.com</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I have recently discovered that your website (trainingspotting.com) is using my RSS feed to make it look as if I'm writing for you. The statement on the site gives the impression that I have contributed freely to your blog:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
This blog exists so trainers, coaches and other learning and development professionals can share their thoughts, experiences and knowledge with others. It’s also a platform to show a little bit about who each of us are, what we add to the community, what value we bring to the table.<br>
<br>
All members of TrainingSpotting.com are able to contribute to the blog, whether it’s articles, just random thoughts or some pertinent information about an upcoming event or class that they think others would want to know about – it’s all welcome.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Please be aware that I have never been approached by any member of the trainingspotting.com team and I have not given permission for my posts to be used in this way.<br>
<br>
The way you work is diametrically opposed to http://www.elearninglearning.com/, who use RSS to collect posts from the elearning community, but only display a small part of the post, with direct links back to the originator's site to read more and to comment.<br>
<br>
I notice that some of your posts do not even attribute the original author. For example, the post on "Taking Coaching to the Ivy League: The Institute of Coaching" was posted on CoachingCommons: http://coachingcommons.org/featured/taking-coaching-to-the-ivy-league-the-institute-of-coaching/<br>
<br>
I wonder if those authors are aware of your behaviour?<br>
<br>
Please could you either:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Remove my posts from your website<br><br>Or<br><br></li><br>
<li>Make it clear that these are copies of my posts, remove the ability to make comments against them, and provide a link back to the original post</li><br>

Thanks Tom.</div><h1>What should elearning look like?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 January 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://patrickdunn.squarespace.com/occasional-rants/2010/1/7/they-pretend-to-train-us-we-pretend-to-learn.html" target="_blank">Patrick Dunn</a> has raised the point that much of what we produce as elearning receives very little positive reaction, and many elearning professionals (myself included) rarely, if ever, use elearning as part of our own development.<br>
<br>
By "elearning", I'm talking about corporate online products that are explicitly designed to fulfil certain learning objectives.<br>
<br>
Thinking about my own experience, and the types of resources that I <strong>do</strong> go to for my own development... Here's what I do, with some examples:<br>
<br>
I use Google to find things out, when I know what I'm looking for.<br>
<br>
I listen to talks and conversations on my mp3 player when I'm looking for inspiration or challenge.<br>
<br>
eg. <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/2006/12/presentation-basics-principle-1" target="_blank">Presentation basics - from Manager Tools</a><br>
eg. <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=14" target="_blank">Stephen Downes on Community Blogging</a><br>
<br>
I watch videos on Youtube, or from TEDtalks. Some are practical how-tos, others more inspirational like the one below.<br>

I use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> to solve programming problems or to get started with new programming languages.<br>
<br>
I've given up on Twitter as a learning tool. It's just too disjointed and distracting.<br>
<br>
I can't remember the last time I worked through a corporate elearning module of my own volition.<br>
<br>
So are there any common features to what I do use?<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: I learn from sources that I respect or have been recommended by people I respect. Is that true of corporate learning resources?</li><br>
  <li><strong>Search</strong>: Corporate learning resources that cannot be found by searching are missing a huge chunk of their potential.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Social publishing</strong>: "Approved" corporate learning resources are often out-of-date by the time they get released and have all the appeal of an old, wet fish. Materials produced by my community of practice are fresh, slightly rough around the edges, mostly relevant and immediately useful.</li><br>
</ul></div><h1>Definition of a learning ecosystem</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 January 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The term "learning ecosystem" seems to be popping up every couple of weeks at the moment. Now that may be because I'm leading a <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/track-2-session-1/#T2S1-1">session on it at the Learning Technologies conference</a>. So I'm just noticing it more. But it's not a term that I'd really come across until late 2009.<br>
<br>
Before "learning ecosytem" becomes another buzzword like "blended learning", ie. meaning everything and anything we do in adult and corporate learning, perhaps we need to be quite clear in defining it.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the biological definition of ecosystem:<br>
<blockquote>a system formed by the interaction of a community of organisms with their physical environment<br>
<br>
http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn<br>
</blockquote><br>
<blockquote>A complex set of relationships of living organisms functioning as a unit and interacting with their physical environment.<br>
<br>
www.ndma.gov.pk/Publications/Terminology_Disaster%20Risk%20Reduction.doc<br>
</blockquote><br>
<blockquote><br>
All of the factors that allow a healthy environment to function; the complex relationships among an area's resources, habitats and residents. An ecosystem may include people, wildlife, fish, trees, water and several other living and non-living elements.<br>
<br>
www.opb.org/programs/oregonstory/land_trusts/glossary/index.html<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Taking these definitions as a starting point, what we have then are three components that make up an ecosystem:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>discrete organisms, each of which is trying to meet its core functions: eat, reproduce and breath</li><br>
  <li>the physical environment within which the organisms carry out those core functions</li><br>
  <li>the complex relationships between the organisms, each other and the environment</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Let's map this onto learning and work:<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr>
<th width="50%">Biological ecosystem</th><th>Learning ecosystem</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>discrete organisms - each trying to meet its core functions</td><td>Individuals - each trying to do its job, get paid, and have a life</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>physical environment</td><td>the work environment: location, space, equipment, IT infrastructure, IT systems etc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>relationships between organisms, each other and the environment</td><td>management and team culture as expressed through delegation, feedback, reaction to mistakes, trust, policies, task allocation etc</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
In a biological ecosystem, every organism plays an essential part. It's impossible for one organism to go it alone. Similarly in a learning ecosystem, every individual has a role. Just as in biology, every organism is a consumer as well as a producer, so in a learning ecosystem every individual's contribution is important for real learning and thus real change to happen.<br>
<br>
In a "controlled" ecosystem, like a garden, the gardener has certain objectives which s/he tries to meet by making careful changes to the system. They may add in a particular organism that has a certain place in the food chain - maybe producing beneficial chemicals or removing unwanted organisms. Or they may change the environment, perhaps increasing nutrients, changing the temperature, or protecting particular organisms from harm.<br>
<br>
A human organisation has all these characteristics. Managers act as the gardener. Absolute control is impossible, but by making tweaks to particular relationships, individuals or the work environment the organisation can be pushed along particular paths.<br>
<br>
In a learning ecosystem, the objective is to induce change to behaviours that meets the overall organisational objectives. Again, forcing people to change is nigh-on impossible. The Learning &amp; Development team can only provide the conditions in which change is more likely.<br>
<br>
Running up to the conference, I will be exploring in more detail what sort of things L&amp;D teams can do in today's work environment.</div><h1>Youtube as a learning ecosystem</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Three examples of people sharing knowledge, giving and gaining feedback and gaining kudos (perhaps).

<blockquote>Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.<br>
</blockquote><br>
I suppose I use the term learning ecosystem as it helps to illustrate the organic, uncontrollable nature of such systems and communities. It's an analogy that people can hook ideas onto, rather than a well thought-out theory. It may help some people understand how to cultivate the community.<br>
<br>
To really dig into the idea of people learning together in communities/ecosystems, you need to read Wenger's work. Or, at least, first of all read his <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/excerpted_from_wenger.htm">vignette of life in a claims processing centre</a>.

Next week, at the Learning Technologies conference, I will be hosting a mini-Moodlemoot; a chance for those of us using Moodle in corporate learning to meet up.<br>
<br>
It will be in <strong>Olympia 2, Room 304 (on level 3) on Thursday from 13:00 to 13:45</strong>.<br>
<br>
You do <strong>not </strong>need a Conference ticket to attend. It is open to all, including Exhibition-only visitors.<br>
<br>
I see this as working as a whole bunch of independent conversations about Moodle, with people able to move in and out of the conversations as they wish. There won't be time for presentations, but feel free to bring laptops etc if you've got something you might want to show people.<br>
<br>
I'll kick off with five questions, as discussion starters for five different groups:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Where does Moodle's social-constructivist background fit into corporate learning?</li><br>
  <li>How do you get round Moodle's really clunky SCORM user-interface?</li><br>
  <li>What additional modules would you recommend to other people?</li><br>
  <li>What server architecture do you use to run your Moodle site?</li><br>
  <li>How do you get user information into your Moodle site? Self-registration? Integration with other systems? Manually?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to this. A good number of people have  expressed an interest in attending.<br>

I had the privilege of working with Patrick Dunn (who is leading the creative network which is <a href="http://www.delearn.net/">The Difference Engine</a>) to run a workshop session on Learning Ecosystems. It seemed to go down well with the few (carefully selected) people that I asked to give feedback.<br>
<br>
Our workshop was followed by <a href="http://www.liquidperformance.co.uk/">Andy Jones</a>, speaking about his experiences of moving "from elearning to knowledge sharing" at Thomson Reuters. At the heart of that was the idea that trainers are not the right people to be taking new ideas out to the workforce. Instead, they pull in champions from the business to design materials, take ownership for them and then to spread the message back in the business. Makes perfect sense, and is a far more scalable and cost-effective way of supporting change.<br>
<br>
There were two things that really grabbed me over the two days:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The amount of evidence, both anecdotal and empirical, to support the concepts/ideas of social learning, communities of practice and learning ecosystems. This came from a range of sources, but primarily <a href="http://www.bersin.com/">Josh Bersin</a> and <a href="http://blogoehlert.typepad.com/">Mark Oehlert</a>. As soon as their slides come online, I'll reflect more on this.</li><br>
  <li>The disconnect between what was happening upstairs at the conference and down on the 2nd floor at the exhibition.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/">Jane Hart</a> described the exhibition as showing "first generation elearning", and I'd have to agree. When asked about what was down there, I described it as "same old, same old". It seemed like every stand was either trying to sell you a Learning Management System, a means of turning Powerpoints into online "learning" materials, or bespoke materials development.<br>
<br>
There were exceptions of course. <a href="http://www.caspianlearning.co.uk/">Caspian Learning</a> stands out, with their Thinking Worlds games designer (review to come), and Infinity Learning, with their <a href="http://infinitylearning.co.uk/elearning/what-we-do/learning-management-systems-lms/involve/">Involve</a> system that takes ideas from Amazon in providing access to learning materials. Although I would like to take issue with their negative statements about free systems (I'm assuming they mean Moodle et al), which are simply spreading unjustified Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt - especially when you consider their own website is built on the open-source Wordpress content management system!<br>
<br>
<h3>Outdated products, which won't work</h3><br>
<br>
Vendors go where the money is. The people holding the purse strings are probably not the ones who are attending the conference. That's a pity, because if they did, they would see that they are, quite often, spending money on outdated ideas - many of which just will not really add any value to the business.<br>
<br>
Outdated is a strong word. But let's take Learning Management Systems as an example. In the discussion below, please note that for me, learning does not equate to remembering. Instead learning = change.<br>
<br>
<div style="float:left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0; font-size: 2em;">L</div><br>
<br>
Many (most) of the systems on the market today are based on the idea that you can <strong>deliver</strong> learning. That learning is a commodity which can be pushed into someone. Nowhere in any educational theory does this concept exist. Behaviourism says that behaviours can be changed based on a stimulus. Cognitivism says that people learn by organising knowledge into coherent structures. Constructivism says that we learn through the process of taking other people's ideas and building our own out of them. Connectivism says that we learn through making connections between internally and externally held knowledge. (For more on these start with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_theory_%28education%29 ).<br>
<br>
Nowhere in these theories is there any space for the statement "delivering learning". Yes, we can deliver materials, lectures, workshops and spaces designed for learning to take place. We don't deliver learning any more than the Tesco's van delivers good health. Learning is an individual process of change.<br>
<br>
<div style="float:left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0; font-size: 2em;">M</div><br>
<br>
OK. So can we <strong>manage</strong> learning? That depends on what you mean by management. For many, management = control. So that's what they look for in a learning <strong>management</strong> system. But can we really control the process of learning? Can we really say who should learn what, and when, and how? No. Not really. We can provide motivational factors, environments that are conducive to learning, and materials that are designed to help people learn. But no way can we say that any of these will ensure learning has taken place.<br>
<br>
Most learning management systems are based around the "management" part, and very little on the learning part. As environments conducive to learning, they are sadly lacking. Similarly very little emphasis is placed on the cultural aspects and the motivating factors which Josh and Mark so eloquently described.<br>
<br>
<div style="float:left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0; font-size: 2em;">S</div><br>
<br>
We like our systems. <strong>I</strong> like systems. They help us feel in control of things. Sometimes they're even useful. The trouble is, the individual process of learning just doesn't fit nicely in systems. Learning is messy. It happens at the oddest times, for the strangest reasons. Trying to systemise learning is like trying to pick up milk in your hands. Yes, some of it might stick, but that will be the exception rather than the rule.<br>
<br>
We do need systems. But we need ones that will are based around learners and the various ways in which they will learn (NB. Not learning styles - they are a discredited concept - but the fact that we all have different factors at different times that will help us to learn better). Systems that are designed around the manager or around the business needs are not learning systems. They might be content delivery systems or tracking systems. But there's no way you can say they are supporting real learning. They simply provide measurements that are easy to make.<br>
<br>
<h3>Return on investment - why bother?</h3><br>
<br>
The constant question that came up throughout the conference was "How do you measure the return on social learning?"<br>
<br>
We're very hung up on that idea. So hung up that we try to measure anything that will stand still long enough. We track "progress" through SCORM packages - knowing full well that all it measures is the number of times someone clicked a button. We count attendance at workshops - although all that shows is your workshops were popular. We quiz people at the end of our materials - knowing that they will have forgotten most of it 20 minutes later.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>We are making the measurable important rather than the important measurable.</blockquote><br>
<br>
What's important? Whether change has taken place in that individual that leads to measurable impact on the organisation.<br>
<br>
These are hard things to measure. We need to accept that. Often only a university research project will collect the hard evidence that shows that it was your learning intervention that made the impact on the organisation.<br>
<br>
I don't believe most L&amp;D departments really want to face the cost of providing that sort of evidence. So, instead, we provide lots of numbers that demonstrate that people like what we're providing. By doing so we run the risk of the business treating the L&amp;D department as irrelevant to the real business.<br>
<br>
So what evidence can we provide that we're actually making a difference?<br>
<br>
A lot of it is a matter of perception. Does the business trust us? Do we speak the language of the business? Do we understand what the business needs are? Are we ready to challenge the business when a performance or a compliance problem is immediately seen as a learning problem? (On that matter, why is compliance <strong>always</strong> seen as a learning problem? In my opinion it's internal communication and management that have the key roles to ensure compliance. L&amp;D have wrongly taken responsibility for it, and thus diminished their standing within the business.)<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, learning is a messy process. Similarly evidence gathering will have to be messy. It might be anecdotal, or based on case studies, or surveys of managers and learners. But it should always focus, not on the learning intervention, but on the change that was intended from it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3><br>
<br>
This rambling reflection has helped me to realise that effective L&amp;D departments must:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>understand the needs of the business in depth and in detail.</li><br>
  <li>create environments, materials and interventions that are based on a solid theoretical understanding of how people learn.</li><br>
  <li>work to ensure that the culture within the organisation becomes more conducive to people sharing, learning and changing</li><br>
  <li>be prepared to use proper educational research methods to evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Changes I would like to see to the conference</h3><br>
<br>
Just to finish off with. There are a few things I think would help to breakdown the disconnect mentioned above:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>More opportunity for vendors to be challenged by the speakers in public</li><br>
  <li>Small group facilitated conversations, perhaps organised by sector, by product or by idea. It is so easy to miss out on conversations that are taking place just because the conference is now so large. So let's structure it a little (not too much!)</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Dealing with the disconnect #LT10uk</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 11 February 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>My <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/01/30/reflections-on-learning-technologies-2010-lt10uk?blog=5">reflections on the Learning Technologies conference</a> have generated a fair bit of discussion.<br>
<br>
Like <a href="http://www.upsidelearning.com/blog">Amit Garg</a> and <a href="http://www.brightwave.co.uk/">Charles Gould</a>, I believe that the disconnect, between what we're hoping for as learning professionals and what is actually being sold &amp; bought, is more about the beliefs and attitudes of those whole hold the purse strings. They need powerful, often monetary, arguments to move away from "traditional" learning mechanisms. The traditional methods provide easily obtained data (attendance, page views, assessment results), which are used as measures of effectiveness, whereas real learning that leads to demonstrable change is actually very hard to measure independently of all the other factors within an organisation. That lack of direct evidence thus makes it incredibly hard for the typical organisation to innovate. Thankfully we heard examples at the conference such as BT's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtVYkEdGtfo">Dare2Share</a> initiative and the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marksylvester/overcoming-the-top-three-challenges-to-building-an-organization-dedicated-to-social-learning">DoD's approach to the three challenges of fear, trust and control</a>.<br>
<br>
However, I also agree with <a href="http://www.optimumlearning.eu/">Phil Green</a> when he says: "I think it is possible to be progressive and innovative in L&amp;D without tearing up AND burying the map". There will <strong>always</strong> be a place for face-to-face workshops and structured distance learning (even instructional) materials. It's just a matter of using the right environment and the right materials for the particular change you're trying to achieve. The problem comes when we try to use one method for every situation. The problem comes when organisations have paid vast sums for one particular type  of software or learning resource. There's every incentive then to make full use of it, regardless of whether it's the right thing to use.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.netdimensions.com/">Jay Shaw</a> made an interesting comment:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Sometimes I think we made a terrible mistake as an industry by calling these systems learning management systems because they're not really about learning, at least not in the senses you mean above. It's not about learning qua learning. It's about making sure the right people get the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it and in forms that are easy for employees to use in their usual work processes. These systems are about helping companies and governments assure staff and user competence in ways that can be verified and validated.</blockquote><br>

The trouble is most of these so-called learning management systems are actually pretty terrible at getting people the information they need to do their jobs when they need it. When I (and most people) need some information to do my job, I go to a search engine and, with intelligent search terms (now that's a skill we need to teach!) usually manage to find something. I've not yet come across an LMS that allows me to search <strong>inside</strong> the content. So I'm then reliant on the navigation structures that the system admin has configured in order to get to the content.<br>
<br>
Now, that's fine for new starters, or people embarking on a new course of study, but dreadful for helping people who just need to refresh a bit of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Jay and <a href="http://www.delearn.net/">Patrick Dunn</a> have made a number of comments about compliance, which appear to be opposing, but actually they're coming at it from two different angles. Jay uses the example of aircraft pilots who have to comply with the rules by undergoing intensive simulator training which gets tracked and assessed automatically. Whereas Patrick is talking about the compliance training that us normal folk have to endure; usually in the diversity and financial areas.<br>
<br>
They just can't be compared. An aircraft simulation is a highly sophisticated piece of software that does its best to mimic real life. I'm <strong>glad</strong> pilots can make mistakes and learn from them! Normal, corporate compliance training is nothing of the sort. As Patrick quoted:  "look - the only reason we're doing this compliance e-learning is to cover ourselves. We're not expecting people to behave differently in any way. If we were, we'd train them properly."<br>
<br>
I would suggest we not be distracted by arguing about situations that bear no relation to each other. Where "compliance training" or any other sort of intervention is obviously having an effect then that's fine. It's when we just accept the status quo because it's easier to do so - that's where we need to talk.<br>
<br>
I was surprised when <a href="http://www.infinitylearning.co.uk/">Robin Hoyle</a> said that vendors were not allowed to speak at the conference. Especially when you consider we've all really got something to sell, even if it's just ourselves. But actually, it's even about who's allowed to speak, because that's still a one-sided conversation in most of the sessions. It's more about setting up forums for conversation where we can discuss openly:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>the commercial pressures that vendors are under</li><br>
  <li>the changes that learning professionals (including vendors!) would like to see</li><br>
  <li>how to stimulate that change by engaging with those who control the money</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
In my view, a good place to start would be by opening up the <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/">Learning &amp; Skills Group Ning community</a> to all interested people <strong>including</strong> vendors. Some simple ground rules, such as those produced for the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle.org_forums_Code_of_Conduct">Moodle community forums</a>, would help avoid difficult situations arising. Most of people who create the products and services we buy are dedicated learning professionals, just as much as the people using those products. We need to learn from, and engage with each other if we are to realise the improvements we all want to see happen!<br>

Apologies for the impassioned and slightly rambling nature of this post!</div><h1>Culture not strategy</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 17 February 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
Social learning, viral marketing, social media, learning ecosystems, communities of practice - all the current buzzwords. Many organisations can see, in principle, what benefits they could extract from the connections between their employees, their customers and the organisation.<br>
<br>
Benefits such as:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Increased creativity</li><br>
  <li>Being closer to the market's needs</li><br>
  <li>Increased exposure</li><br>
  <li>Viral spread of messages</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
But how you go about it?<br>
<br>
Is it about creating strategies, setting targets, implementing systems, measuring return on investment?<br>
<br>
Would you do that for conversation?<br>
<br>
Of course not.<br>
<br>
Realising the potential of the connections within your organisation, and between your organisation and the people outside it, is not about strategies, systems, programmes or any of the other management techniques we've grown up with. It's about culture. [UPDATE: for more on what we mean by culture see <a href="http://patrickdunn.squarespace.com/occasional-rants/2010/2/17/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast-yes-but-lets-be-clear-wh.html">Patrick's post - Culture eats strategy for breakfast...</a>]<br>
<br>
If you have a culture that learns from mistakes, that devolves responsibility, and expects your people to engage with others about what you do (like the <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/MediaandPublicCommunicationPublications/OnlineEngagementGuidelines.htm">Ministry of Defence</a>?), then you are likely to be pretty strong on the social media front.<br>
<br>
If, however, you allow that culture to be blocked by fear, (lack of) trust and control (see <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marksylvester/overcoming-the-top-three-challenges-to-building-an-organization-dedicated-to-social-learning">Mark Oehlert's and Mark Sylvester's presentation on Slideshare</a> below) then, no matter how much you might want to use "social" strategies, you're probably not going to succeed.<br>

I spend my life working with databases of one sort or other. They are wonderful things; helping organise information and increase the usefulness and value of that information.<br>
<br>
Yet, regardless of how useful they can be, I cannot see that this outweighs the security, privacy and cost concerns raised by the UK government's ongoing plans to store citizen's personal details on a central National Identity Management System.<br>
<br>
In fact, I can see very little this <b>is</b> useful in these plans. There is no evidence that they will combat terrorism, illegal immigration, benefit fraud or identity fraud.<br>
<br>
That's why I've put the <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">No2ID</a> badge on this site. Can I suggest you take a look at their site and do the same.

Not just hardware, but software too.<br>
<br>
I take new systems and new kit and push them to see a) how they work and b) when they break.<br>
<br>
That's fine, but I know that people around me don't necessarily want to move at the same pace. At least not using the tools &amp; systems that I use. That's for a variety of reasons - cost, fear, no immediate need etc.<br>
<br>
That's why my role at work tends to involve elements of looking forward - to see what's coming down the line so that we're ready when it becomes mainstream - and elements of looking at what we're currently using - to make sure we're using it to best effect.<br>
<br>
So, Bill Lord's post "<a href="http://lordlit.wordpress.com/2010/02/23/flattening-out-the-rollercoaster/">Flattening out the rollercoaster</a>" had a lot of resonances with me. In it, he describes how he deliberately slowed the pace of change (re. ICT) in his school. They "pulled back the pioneers" and set them to support those were struggling to keep up their understanding of what they were already using.<br>
<br>
The effect of this was described by a visitor from the <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/">DCSF</a>: <strong>“You don’t have a huge amount of kit but what you do have is used all of the time.”</strong><br>
<br>
That contrasted hugely with my experiences in most schools which contain cupboards (and walls in the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_whiteboard">IWBs</a>) <strong>full</strong> of unused software and hardware. Often bought with government seed funding, but with no real idea of how it would be implemented and used effectively.<br>
<br>
There will always be a role for pioneers - mapping out and testing the future direction. At the other end we mustn't be afraid of getting rid of equipment and systems that are past their useful life.<br>
<br>
However, the majority of our effort must be in making sure that the direction we choose is taken wholeheartedly so that the most benefit is achieved.<br>
<br>
Sometimes that will mean a slow-down. Not a stop. Just a slow-down.</div><h1>Reflections on the Oxford Teachmeet Fishbowl</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 February 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><em>Teachmeet: A meeting of teachers to share ideas, be inspired and develop personal learning networks</em><br>
<br>
I've just come away from a pilot <a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/Oxford-Fishbowl">Teachmeet Fishbowl in Oxford</a>. <br>
<br>
It was different from the "normal" Teachmeet, where individuals are selected at random to briefly present what they have learnt (See <a href="http://www.brainpop.co.uk/">BrainPop's</a> Intro to Teachmeets video below). Instead the <a href="http://www.unconference.net/unconference-methods-fish-bowl-dialogue/">Fishbowl dialogue technique</a> was used (extremely effectively!) to kick start the discussions.<br>
<br>
I was invited along as an observer, and to highlight some of the key points that arose.<br>
<br>
<h3>The Primary National Curriculum has changed</h3><br>
<br>
If you're not directly involved with teaching this may come as news to you. The 20 year old, highly proscriptive National Curriculum has recently been replaced with something much more flexible and suitable for 21st Century learners:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/primary_curriculum.png"><img src="./assets/primary_curriculum.png" alt="Primary Curriculum" title="Primary Curriculum" width="384" height="362"></a></div><br>
<br>
The event was designed to look at how schools can develop a more creative curriculum planning process, which focussed on the Key Skills and allowed teachers to meet the real, individual and local needs of their pupils.<br>
<br>
<h3>Creative planning</h3><br>
<br>
Since the introduction of the National Strategies in the 1990's, teachers have been encouraged to follow highly structured planning processes:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Long term plans - which identify the subjects and the objectives (sourced from both National Curriculum and National Strategies) to be covered for each term</li><br>
  <li>Medium term plans - which identify the timetable for each week and when particular objectives will be covered</li><br>
  <li>Short term plans - which identify the activities for each lesson, the resources required, assessment activities, how activities will be differentiated etc</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
As time went on, these planning templates have become extremely complex. So much so that when I saw <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/track-4-session-3/">Julie Wedgewood's impressive storyboarding templates at Learning Technologies 2010</a> I immediately thought: "These look like lesson plans".<br>
<br>
The problem with this process has been threefold:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>They lock you into a series of activities - with very little room for flexibility</li><br>
  <li>They often become box-ticking exercises, used by senior management teams as part of their monitoring function, but with no real engagement by management in the quality of the lessons</li><br>
  <li>They are extremely onerous to complete (See my earlier post on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/11/07/reducing-teacher-workload?blog=5">reducing teacher workload</a>). Every night primary school teachers up and down the land are copying &amp; pasting statements from various curriculum documents into their plans and frantically trying to document activities, resources and assessments - purely to meet the top-down monitoring requirements.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
The approach being looked at in Oxford took a much more creative and flexible view of things. It was led (via a Skype video call) by <a href="http://edte.ch/blog/">Tom Barrett</a>, an inspiring primary teacher from Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>
Rather than the focus being subject knowledge, instead the focus became the Key Skills (within each of the 6 areas of learning) that were desired as outcomes. This, then, allows the teacher to use their own creativity and passions to develop these Key Skills in their children.<br>
<br>
<h3>Adaptive planning</h3><br>
<br>
Rather than setting plans in stone at the beginning of the week, instead we discussed how "skeleton plans" could be used. These would then flex throughout the week, allowing them them to adapt based on how the children react and discover. The plans become working documents, to be annotated during the week with extra ideas, resources and evidence of attainment.<br>
<br>
The advantage of continually working with the plans means that you will continually reflect on them. Unlike the old style plans which became out-of-date immediately they were submitted at the beginning of the week, and were rarely evaluated. (At least in my experience!)<br>
<br>
Teachers who already use this approach were saying that monitoring by senior management had become much more of a conversation, rather than a process to be undergone. Far healthier, and far more conducive to <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/11/01/rebuilding-teacher-professionalism?blog=5">rebuilding teacher professionalism</a>, I would say...<br>
<br>
My only worries are these:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The open, creative planning process means we run the risk of our children "doing the Romans" (or whatever is the current fun thing to do) year after year. So, some long term planning will still be needed.</li><br>
  <li>The structure provided by the old system meant that it was possible to share and reuse plans quite easily. We may find that teachers are now continually reinventing the wheel.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
The answer to both those worries is a much more open, shared approach to planning:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Every teacher should be encouraged to have a blog/twitter account/RSS reader - a means of <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/11/19/getting-started-with-social-software-for-learning?blog=5">joining in to the existing networks.</a></li><br>
  <li>As I commented on <a href="http://edte.ch/blog/2010/02/20/are-we-the-resource-i-have-been-looking-for">Tom Barrett's blog post about teacher networks</a> I do think there's room for some sort of social lesson-planning tool. We need something to help make the planning &amp; documentation process less onerous and time-consuming. It should allow<br>
individual schools do the top-down allocation of National Curriculum skills and objectives to teachers/year groups. It should allow schools to get an overview of what's going on (to avoid duplication). And it should enable teachers to share resources and activities. Such a tool would complement the reflection taking place in the networks and should focus primarily on the planning process. Although there's still the ongoing issue of how and where to annotate plans and provide evidence. Perhaps it needs linking to some sort of online assessment management tool? But that would be a whole other ball game, with huge privacy and child protection issues.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Anyway, that's the end of my reflections. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesateynsham">James Bird</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/eylanezekiel">Eylan Ezekiel</a> for organising the Teachmeet, and to BrainPop for the food! Now it's over to Moby:<br>

[youtube]SlSQYSnPUQY[/youtube]</div><h1>Coping with Twitter</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 26 February 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
Twitter is a great tool for spreading messages and ideas through your network. It also devours time. Not every Twitter message posted by the people you follow will be relevant to you. It's a bit like being in a big hall with a large group of people shouting at you, and then you shouting out anything that comes into your head. Not really a good environment for a conversation.<br>
<br>
I've decided that I just don't have enough spare time to listen in to all the people I follow. Instead I'm going to use Twitter more strategically.<br>
<br>
<h3>Time-limited sessions</h3><br>
<br>
As a means of collecting together ideas around an event, Twitter is hard to beat. Simply attach an event-specific tag (like #LT10uk) to your post and it can then become part of a list of tweets filtered on that tag. Again, not so good for conversation, but ideal to pick up what's grabbing people's attention.<br>
<br>
<h3>Use RSS to pick up your Twitter feed</h3><br>
<br>
I have an RSS set up for any Tweet containing @berthelemy. This comes into Google Reader. It means I don't miss messages directed to me, but also means they come to me, rather than me having to go to a Twitter client, with the potential for time-wasting that will involve.<br>
<br>
I can do a similar thing for any other saved search.<br>
<br>
<h3>Post via RSS to Twitter</h3><br>
<br>
With <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a>, any new post or comment on my blog automatically gets posted to my Twitter network. Again, it means I avoid using a Twitter client.<br>
<br>
<h3>Use a Twitter client sparingly</h3><br>
<br>
As you can see I will rarely use a Twitter client (like Twitterfall). What this means is that I will then make a deliberate decision to spend time with the people I follow.<br>
<br>
How do you make sure Twitter doesn't devour your time?</div><h1>Network publishing</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 27 February 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>

Here's an update to yesterday's post about <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/02/26/coping-with-twitter?blog=5">coping with Twitter</a>.<br>
<br>
I've tried to illustrate how the links work on the diagram below. Basically I'm trying to work on the principle of Write Once Publish Many (WOPM).<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/network_publishing.001.png"><img src="./assets/network_publishing.001.png" alt="Network publishing" title="Network publishing" width="400" height="300"></a></div></div><h1>Commercial publishing in a networked world</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 4 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
As we know <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">publishing faces huge challenges</a> at the moment. It's not just newspapers. I'm talking books, magazines, video, photography - pretty much any sort of "content".<br>
<br>
In this post, I'm  going to focus very much on educational publishing - as that's the world I'm most familiar with.<br>
<br>
The main challenges, as I see them, are:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><strong>Availability of free content</strong> - via social publishing platforms, such as Youtube, Slideshare, Flickr etc as well as individual blogs and personal websites. The cost to entry for publishing is now so low as to be almost negligible.</li><br>
  <li><strong>There is an inverse relationship between cost of sale and relevance to the end-user.</strong>. To bring down the cost of sale, publishers try to do bulk deals with representatives of the largest organisations (nationally ideally, then local authorities, then consortia, then schools, and then departments, teachers or even students).  Yet, the prevailing model these days is disaggregation (cf. iTunes) and long-tail marketing (cf. Amazon). The lower down the chain you can make your sale, the more likely you are that your product will be used. The higher up you make it, the less connected you will be with your target market.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Many of the end-users (students) are digitally confident.</strong> They are used to making comments about stuff they use. They'll put their feedback on Twitter, Facebook, Bebo etc - whereever is the current fashion. They expect to be able to interact with each other and with the product owner.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Learning is becoming mobile.</strong> Much online content is designed for classroom-based desktop or laptop PCs, whereas students will soon expect content to be available on their mobile devices. This brings the added complications of choosing whether to deliver via a browser or to design an application (for which there are at least three different platforms).</li><br>
  <li><strong>Learners expect interaction.</strong> Much educational (and training) content is designed to be one way communication: content -&gt; learner, whereas the prevailing model that works on the web (and is a far better fit for modern learning theory) is very much multi-way: users able to make comments, ask questions, and get answers from their peers.</li><br>
  <li><strong>You are not in control of your message.</strong> Whatever you might think, you are no longer in control of the message. Your ideas will get edited, mashed-up, republished, commented on, blogged or even tweeted. See this <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media.html">example from TED Talks</a>.</li><br>
  <li><strong>The time to market from initial idea to finished product is too long</strong> to maintain currency in a rapidly changing world. By the time articles or resources have been through the publishing process things have often moved on. The curriculum may have changed. The tools teachers use may change. The things that are currently grabbing students' attention will have changed.</li><br>
  <li><strong>There is a conflict in the publisher's role.</strong> Is it to produce materials that maintain the status quo? Or should it be to produce materials which challenge the way teaching and learning happens in educational organisations.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Before we give up now, let's take a look at the value publishers add to content:<br>
<ul><br>
<li><strong>They ensure that the appropriate rights to publish are obtained.</strong> Yes, I know we should all be using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons licensing</a>, but that's not possible when you make your living from creating high quality graphics or well-crafted text. It's fine for some people and organisations to give content away, perhaps when it's not their core product. Not so much when you have sweated night and day to create a brilliant piece of work.</li><br>
  <li><strong>They match content to curriculum and ability</strong>. This makes it easier (in theory) for a busy educator to find the right piece of content for their students. All the free content available should make this unnecessary, but not every teacher has the time to hunt down that elusive image or flash game.</li><br>
  <li><strong>They provide the finishing touches that turn a great idea into a great product</strong>. It may be a professional voiceover, a consistent graphical style, or programming expertise. All that takes time.</li><br>
  <li><strong>They provide the editorial expertise</strong>. Editors know their audience, they know what makes them tick, they know how to turn that flowery prose into a finely crafted article, and they provide the driving force that creates a consistently successful product.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Educational publishing is already a synergistic process. The diagram below attempts to show that.<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/network_publishing_process.001.png"><img src="./assets/network_publishing_process.001.png" alt="Network publishing process" title="Network publishing process" width="400" height="300"></a></div><br>
<br>
There's not much that can be done to speed up the publishing process. Where improvements can be made is in the process that happens before the ideas/materials get to the publishers, and then in the way that resources are made available to the end users.<br>
<br>
Things change so quickly these days partly because of the positive feedback that can happen in networks (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Publishers have a role in the network, whether it's providing platforms (online or face-to-face) for collaboration, filtering and feedback. Or whether it's just in encouraging and  experimentation and creativity, and disseminating those results.</div><h1>Training is not (always) the answer</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 May 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
How many times do you hear "lack of training" stated as the reason behind a lack of performance? Or that someone has been "sent for retraining" following an incident?<br>
<br>
All too often training is seen as the answer to every problem.<br>
<br>
Yet ... <br>
<br>
<blockquote>... <strong>most performance deficiencies in the workplace are due to environmental factors such as vague expectations, insufficient and untimely feedback, limited access to required information, inadequate tools, resources and procedures, inappropriate and counterproductive incentives, etc.</strong><br>
<br>
Yet, when a performance gap occurs, the default intervention is all too often training – although it is much easier to fix the environment then people. To put it in simple terms – if the gap is not due to a lack of skills and knowledge, don't train!<br>
<br>
Moreover, even when you determine that training is necessary, is it sufficient? A one-shot training injection rarely works if it is not part of a total performance system. </blockquote><br>

<br>
Last week's Learning &amp; Skills Group webinar on <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/forum/topics/march-4th-2010-how-companies">How Companies are Making the Most of Moodle</a> attracted over 200 people and stimulated a huge amount of conversation in the chat room.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.kineo.com/management-team/steve-rayson.html">Steve Rayson (from Kineo)</a> gave a superb overview of how companies have used Moodle as the basis for a whole range of training, performance analysis and communication purposes. He talked about the potential for Moodle to adapt through new theme packs or custom-built modules.<br>
<br>
There were a lot of people attending for whom even this high level talk about coding, HTML, CSS and other techie stuff was too much. Many of the questions asked seemed to indicate that they wanted to know the basics about how Moodle could help them without any customisation. It was like they were expecting Moodle to be the Holy Grail - the free application that would solve <strong>all</strong> their training problems.<br>
<br>
What I'm going to attempt to do here is show how Moodle <strong>can</strong> help corporate L&amp;D departments out-of-the-box, and also describe what it <strong>cannot</strong> do without customisation.<br>
<br>
This will be very much an outline of the possible, rather than an in-depth exploration. If you want to know more leave a question in the feedback box, or drop me an email.<br>

<br>
<strong>Moodle is free</strong>. That's probably the most important thing to get your head around. It's free to download, free to use, and free to adapt.<br>

That doesn't mean that it won't cost you anything to use Moodle. As soon as you start wanting to get real learners into your site you'll need to consider costs of things like hosting, bandwidth and support. Now, if you're in a company with a friendly IT department that may come as part of their service to you. But it may not... You might even want to consider purchasing these services from a <a href="http://moodle.com/partners">Moodle Partner</a> (companies that specialise in Moodle).<br>
<br>
The difference between Moodle and most proprietary (ie. closed source) applications is that you've got a choice. You can scale up exactly how you want to, without <strong>any</strong> financial barrier to getting started. You can even install a working copy on your own <a href="http://download.moodle.org/macosx/">Mac</a> or <a href="http://download.moodle.org/windows/">Windows PC</a> without having to know anything about webservers, databases and the like.<br>
<br>
<h3>Moodle is simple to install</h3><br>
<br>
Once you've outgrown your own local version of Moodle, you'll need to get it installed somewhere. This is where your IT department will love you. Once the basic webserver and database server is setup (and the complexity here depends on how big and secure you need your site to be), actually installing Moodle is a doddle. It's the sort of thing a competent IT person can do in less than an hour.<br>
<br>
<h3>Moodle is a Course Management System</h3><br>
<br>
Yes, I said "course". Not a learning management system or a learning content management system. The course paradigm runs strongly throughout the whole Moodle architecture. In Moodle terms, a course is the place where "resources" are published and used and where learners undertake "activities". Individuals have "roles" inside the course which give certain permissions. Out-of-the-box, you have "teachers" who can set up and run the course, and "students" who will do the activities.<br>
<br>
It's important to understand this idea of the course, which is very different from your typical corporate elearning course. A Moodle course can contain many resources, which might include your SCORM packages (although these are classed as activities), as well as links to external sites, uploaded documents and even web-pages that you can create within Moodle's editor.<br>
<br>
Similarly, a Moodle course can contain as many forums, wikis, quizzes and other activity types as you wish. Remember that, in the wild, Moodle is designed to be used with a teacher facilitating these activities - perhaps gradually introducing them over a period of time. In corporate situations, this model is less likely. So you need to consider very carefully how complex you want your course to become. Generally, the less teacher - student interaction there will be, the more simple you need to keep your course.<br>
<br>
From the teacher's perspective, compared to similar systems, Moodle is a breath of fresh air. It allows complete control over how the course will work, with an interface that is designed around the needs of the teacher. Adding resources and activities follows a well-honed workflow that just makes sense.<br>
<br>
Three things to remember at this point:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong> are things that will be used by the learner to help complete activities.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Activities</strong> are things that can publish marks/data into the student gradebook (like a schoolteacher's markbook). That's why the SCORM packages are classed as activities.</li><br>
  <li>All the language can be changed very easily so don't worry about whether you'll have students or learners or participants.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Moodle is brilliant at user management</h3><br>
<br>
This is one of the reasons why so many corporates are taking the Moodle route and then adding their custom-built modules. At the heart of Moodle is a user-management system that many applications would do well to copy.<br>
<br>
The ideal is to reduce the administration overhead (ie. people doing admin tasks manually) to zero. A well-configured Moodle site can do this almost completely. I've run a number of large Moodle sites (including a County Council, a division of a large corporate, and a national teacher professional development site). With all of them I've designed the admin processes so that they can be user-driven. As well as reduced the initial admin, this also cuts down on the number of support calls.<br>
<br>
Here are three simple steps that you can do to bring down your admin overhead on your Moodle site. They assume you don't want any integration with existing systems.<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Use email authentication - this is the default authentication system in Moodle. It does rely on everyone knowing their email address (not always in true in my experience!)</li><br>
  <li>Allow self-registration, perhaps limiting new users to those from a particular email domain if you don't want all and sundry to register.</li><br>
  <li>Use enrolment keys on your courses. These act like passwords for each course. Once a user has entered the key they will be enrolled in the course and won't need to enter it again. If you want to group your users within the course for reporting purposes, then you can give each group it's own unique enrolment key. (NB. Out-of-the-box, Moodle has no means of grouping people on a site-wide basis. If you want to do that, then you'll need the rather excellent <a href="http://www.aardpress.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=97">Moomis</a> add-on. I'll be reviewing this some point soon.)</li><br>
</ol> <br>
<br>
If you do have existing systems, again, Moodle has functionality built-in that can help with the integration, whether it's a batch upload of users or a more sophisticated check against the external system at the point of login. (To be honest most integration difficulties come from the external systems rather than Moodle). For more info see: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Authentication<br>
<br>
That's probably enough for now. Future articles will look at the various add-ons for Moodle, the techniques I've used to create self-study systems, and when and how to use the activities at the heart of Moodle: forums, wikis and assessments.</div><h1>Creating a podcast</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There are three stages to creating and delivering a podcast: planning, production and delivery.<br>
<br>
<h3>Planning</h3><br>
<br>
Consider what style you're going to adopt.<br>
<br>
Options include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Monologue</li><br>
  <li>Dialogue / conversation</li><br>
  <li>News bulletin</li><br>
  <li>Interview</li><br>
  <li>Set of feature articles</li><br>
  <li>Story-telling</li><br>
  <li>Radio play</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The dialogue and interview options tend to work well. Examples include <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager Tools</a>, <a href="http://topbriefings.typepad.com/duncangotobed/podcast/">Top Briefings</a>, <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/index/podcasts/">Towards Maturity</a>.<br>
<br>
Monologues, unless you have a very charismatic presenter, or a very motivated audience, are hard to listen to.<br>
<br>
Feature articles, story-telling and radio plays tend to require much higher production values and scripts. You're competing with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4">Radio 4</a> for listeners after all!<br>
<br>
Even if you go for the interview/dialogue option, you'll still need to plan out the basic structure of what you're going to talk about. Make sure your interviewee has time to plan out their responses too.<br>
<br>

<a href="http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/05-choosing-your-podcast-format.htm">Choosing your podcast format</a><br>
<br>
<h3>Production</h3><br>
<br>
You will need:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A quiet, acoustically "dead" place to record. <a href="http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/07-podcast-recording-location.htm">Somewhere with lots of curtains or clothes around you is ideal</a>.</li><br>
  <li>A decent microphone. This could be one that plugs into your laptop via USB (eg. <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/PRODUCTS/productpage.cfm?prodID=1810">Samson's C01U</a> (there are many others). Or you could use an all-in-one recorder (like the excellent <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h2/">Zoom H2</a>)</li><br>
  <li>A means of storing the audio in a digital format. You could use the aforementioned Zoom H2, or plug a microphone into your laptop/desktop (be careful of fan noise).</li><br>
  <li>Software to do the recording and editing. The Zoom H2 will handle all the recording, but not editing. If you're using a computer-based solution then you could use <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> (an extremely powerful but simple to use open source tool), or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> (free with every Mac - and also highly recommended).</li><br>
  <li>Time. Dialogues take less editing than most other types of podcast. But still allow time to plan, record and then edit the podcast - in roughly equal quantities.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The production process goes as follows:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Record raw materials</li><br>
  <li>Edit together the raw materials with any additional sound effects, intro and outro sections etc</li><br>
  <li>Save with a suitable bit-rate to ensure minimum size and maximum quality. There's a balance to be made here. I wouldn't expect any 30 minute podcast to be more than about 10Mb. You can make them smaller by reducing quality and publishing in mono. But lower quality means they're harder to listen to.</li><br>
  <li>Add the appropriate mp3 ID3 tags to your recording. Audacity does this as part of the export process, but there are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5266613/six-best-mp3-tagging-tools">other tools available</a>. The ID3 tags help listeners to find the file within their mp3 players.</li><br>
  <li>Publish to a suitable website (see next section).</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Delivery</h3><br>
<br>
There are three ways to listen to a podcast. The ideal delivery platform should handle all three:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>By going to the website and using a player like the one below.<br>[dewplayer:http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/media/blogs/mark/RSS_workshop_intro.mp3]</li><br>
  <li>By going to the website and downloading the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/media/blogs/mark/RSS_workshop_intro.mp3">mp3 file</a>.</li><br>
  <li>By setting your media software (eg. iTunes) to catch and download the podcast automatically, via your site's RSS 2.0 feed.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, your website needs to be able to:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>handle uploading an mp3 file</li><br>
  <li>put an mp3 player on the page when given an mp3 file to deal with</li><br>
  <li>create a link to the mp3 file</li><br>
  <li>build an RSS 2.0 feed</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
This should all be handled automatically by the website application. <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> and <a href="http://www.loudblog.com/">Loudblog</a> are all good, solid applications that will provide a basis for podcasting. If all you're doing is podcasting, then Loudblog is your best bet. [UPDATE: Just discovered that Loudblog looks like it's being superceded by <a href="http://www.podhawk.com/">PodHawk</a>]<br>
<br>
If you want to publish your podcast via the iTunes store, then follow <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23478?viewlocale=en_US">Apple's instructions</a>.<br>

<br>
Hi Donald,<br>
<br>
An inciteful post as usual. The problems with Moodle's Partner structure has been evident for a while. Bigger companies have chosen to go it alone, simply because it seems they're unable to get on the Partner list - yet there's no published statement (that I'm aware of) which says how Partners are chosen.<br>
<br>
Having said that, the idea of the Partner is a good one, as it ensures the long term viability of the Moodle project. Each partner has to contribute to the project in some way or other.<br>
<br>
Personally I would prefer to see a structure based around accreditation (ie. demonstration of expertise in one or more aspects of Moodle in one or more contexts). Accreditation could be at individual or company level, with the applicant paying an appropriate amount.<br>
<br>
Organisations offering Moodle services (and thus wanting to use the Moodle brand), should get accreditation, and then pay to use the brand. The amount depending on the size of the organisation and the type of services offered.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter how many of these "Partners" there are in a particular part of the world. Competition is good.<br>
<br>
I would like to pick up your point about "constructivist" learning. I agree in some ways that it is a utopian dream. Prof Gilly Salmon does have experience of making it work at the OU and at Leicester, and I have seen it working personally in a year long development project for teacher trainers. The problem with the constructivist approach is that it takes time. Lots of it. As a model for a long-term management development programme it would work well, but for an induction programme it's a waste.<br>
<br>
There is a significant difference in the way Moodle works to support the constructivist model as compared to other VLE's and LMS's (which tend to have their roots in the behaviourist approach that most corporates seem to think is the way to do all learning):<br>
<br>
A Moodle course can be built around the interactions that will take place over time between teachers and students. Most VLE's have a content space and a discussion space and never the twain should meet.<br>
<br>
As for the future of Moodle? I think anyone who decides to fork the project will have to be very aware of what they will be losing out on in terms of the vast beta testing and support community out there. Most corporate Moodlers don't seem to be too involved with that side of things, leaving it to the academic institutions. So any separate corporate Moodle will need a large organisation with resources behind it to ensure that the software continues to develop with the quality we've come to expect.</div><h1>Technorati claim post - please ignore</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>C4MNXU285D7A</div><h1>The Perfect Client</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
Some years ago, I was working as a learning designer on a national change project which dealt with almost every NHS Hospital Trust in the country. It was being closely monitored by the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit, which meant it had a pretty high profile.<br>
<br>
The project involved creating online learning materials, a performance support tool, workshop materials, and delivering workshops for Trust change managers designed to help them facilitate change within their organisations.<br>
<br>
The subject matter was complex and, if adopted, was going to have considerable impact on staff and processes in the hospitals.<br>
<br>
Thankfully the whole project was a great success. It achieved its measurable target objectives, everything was delivered on time, and within budget. Yes, there were sticky patches - as with <strong>every</strong> project. But what really made this one work was the client.<br>
<br>
There were some key things within our relationship with the client that made the difference:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The client organisation delegated decisions about the content to one person. That person was the trusted subject matter expert (SME) and he knew what was needed to achieve the aims of the project.</li><br>
  <li>When reporting back to the client-side project board, the SME's role was to explain the decisions he'd made and persuade the project board to sign-off finished work products.</li><br>
  <li>The project board's role was to ratify decisions made by the SME at key milestones in the project.</li><br>
  <li>Materials were reviewed every two weeks during a two-day workshop. Day 1 involved reporting back to the SME on what had been achieved in the previous two weeks. Day 2 was about working together, with the SME, on what would happen in the next two weeks. During these workshops decisions were made.</li><br>
  <li>The SME's role between workshops was to clarify design and content issues with his organisation, ready for the next review workshop.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
It's rare to find an organisation that is willing to delegate such responsibility for such a high profile project down to one person. But, when it does, the whole process can become much more iterative and productive.</div><h1>Using Yammer</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> is a "real-time communication platform for companies, groups and organizations."<br>
<br>
It's a bit like having Twitter, but only for your company. But only a bit. In fact it's far better than Twitter in a lot of ways. Here are some of the key features that I think are important:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Messages can be any length</li><br>
  <li>Messages can have files attached</li><br>
  <li>Conversations are threaded!</li><br>
  <li>You can create groups within your organisation's Yammer space</li><br>
  <li>You can choose how you want to be notified of new things - whether by email, text (SMS) or not at all</li><br>
  <li>You can auto-post from Twitter using the #yam <a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/49309">hashtag</a></li><br>
  <li>You can link posts using #tags</li><br>
  <li>You can reply via email</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The difference between a forum tool and a social communications tool is that forums are centred on the conversation, whereas social tools are centred on the individual. To keep in touch with what's going on on a forum you need to subscribe to the whole forum, or a sub-section of it. That's fine when conversations neatly split up into topics. The <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/forums">Manager-Tools forum</a> is an excellent example.<br>
<br>
Where a social communications tool, like Yammer, wins out, is when you want to stay in touch with the all the conversations that your particular colleagues are having. Yes, some of them will be irrelevant, but that's just like being in the office. For a distributed team, social tools can be invaluable for keeping your finger on the pulse.<br>
<br>
But what about email? In my view, email should only be used when one or more of the following conditions are met:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The message should only go to a tightly defined set of people</li><br>
  <li>You want to be sure the recipient will receive the message</li><br>
  <li>You are not worried about keeping a centralised audit trail</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, enough about email. Are there any downsides to using Yammer?<br>
<br>
<h3>When Yammer doesn't work</h3><br>
<br>
It's not Yammer's fault when it doesn't work. And most of the time it's not even a technical problem (although Yammer does rely on everyone in the organisation having the same email domain).<br>
<br>
The main reason Yammer doesn't live up to expectations is cultural.<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>We're not used to sharing our thoughts online, as we think them</li><br>
  <li>Some of the team don't work remotely, so there's no immediate benefit to sharing their ideas online</li><br>
  <li>There are concerns about privacy or security</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
What are the best ways then of making sure that Yammer lives up to its promises.<br>
<br>
<h3>Making the most of Yammer</h3><br>
<br>
When used well, Yammer should make your teams more connected and productive. But how can we encourage its use:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Use it yourself. Gradually start to push out notices and ideas via Yammer instead of through email alone. Get people used to seeing the Yammer name. At first it will feel like you're talking into a vacuum. Over time, with encouragement, others will join.</li><br>
  <li>Auto-publish from your blog or Facebook via the #yam Twitter hashtag.</li><br>
  <li>If you're worried about privacy, create a Private Group. If you're worried about Yammer and privacy in general, look at their <a href="https://www.yammer.com/company/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. It should allay your fears.</li><br>
  <li>Spread the word. Invite people. Add your Yammer profile URL to your email signature.</li><br>
  </ol><br>
<br>
Being the first in Yammer is a bit like being the first person in your town with a telephone. But get others involved and it'll be a lot more useful.<br>
<br>
The one thing to remember is that (like Twitter or a blog), you can never guarantee whether people have received your message. It's a pull medium, like television or radio. Your followers can always choose to unfollow. So, keep your posts to the point and useful to your colleagues.</div><h1>Design principles for learning materials</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
This post attempts to set out some design principles to guide us when creating learning materials.<br>
<br>
Like the laws of music, these principles are designed to be broken, but only when there’s good reason to do so.<br>
<br>
When we create mixed packages, we need to decide which design characteristics from each type should be adopted.<br>
<br>
I've identified three main types of learning materials:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Reference/performance support - designed primarily to enable users to find up-to-date information, guidance and tutorials quickly</li><br>
  <li>Tutorial - designed to present a way of doing a task or to introduce a concept<br>
</li><br>
  <li>Hearts and minds - designed to change attitudes, stimulate a need or promote an idea<br>
</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
For each of these I have listed below some examples, how they might be used, and the principle design characteristics (some essential and some optional). Out of necessity, these are simplistic, but I hope they're useful as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristic</a> approach to design. Obviously I would welcome any comments or criticism.<br>

</ul></div><h1>Social media and the transformation process</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
"Transformation", when you talk about organisations, is much more than making individual tweaks or changes to specific systems or parts of the organisation. <br>
<br>
According to <a href="http://www.oakleigh.co.uk/page/110/Services/Education/Articles/Organisational-Transformation">Oakleigh Consulting</a>, the keys to organisational transformation are (NB. my emphasis):<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Looking at the whole system - typically these can be broken down into people, technology and processes. Any change will impact on all three of these areas and each must respond.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Involving stakeholders at all stages and at all levels.</strong></li><br>
  <li>Having a clear (and measurable) vision of a future state.</li><br>
  <li>Having a comprehensive programme to manage the change.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
As <a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/papers/transformation_process.htm">Matt Taylor</a> writes, in his excellent discussion paper on the Transformation Process:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Transformation is not something you do to an organization. It is a process that you go through yourself.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I don't want to simplify transformation here, as there are no short cuts to making it happen.<br>
<br>
I'm suggesting that, since organisational transformation is about every person in the organisation changing the way they do things, we should be looking at social media tools &amp; techniques to communicate throughout the process.<br>
<br>
Social media starts with, and is centred on, the individual. It's like word of mouth, but faster, more accurate and has much higher visibility and accountability.<br>
<br>
Networks of individuals are built up through "trust relationships". That trust might develop over time, as individuals contribute useful ideas, or it might already exist - perhaps through existing organisational structures or face-to-face relationships.<br>
<br>
There are two approaches you could use if you're introducing a new tool to support your social networks:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Buy in, install and configure a social media platform.</li><br>
  <li>Use an existing platform that allows closed networks (like Yammer, or Ning). I currently prefer Yammer as it is simple in concept, free for basic use, email domain based, and integrates far better with existing comms tools like email and SMS.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
The trick then is to persuade people to use it. This <strong>must</strong> be done in conjunction with traditional media - posters, newsletters, presentations etc. Every time you would have normally put your intranet page address, or your personal email, say "Find me on Yammer (or whatever)".<br>
<br>
Then, you need to start posting useful materials onto your social media platform. I've suggested a few do's and don'ts below. I'm sure they can be added to. If you follow them, then your network will grow, and will gradually get connected to other networks inside the organisation. That's how change will happen.<br>
<br>
<h3>Do's</h3><br>
Keep it simple.<br>
Post frequently - but don't overload it. Probably every couple of days is enough to get started.<br>
Be real.<br>
Tell stories<br>
Ask questions.<br>
Make explicit links between your traditional communications and your social media communications.<br>
Respond to questions and comments.<br>
Demonstrate how to use the platform for retrieving previous ideas, sharing knowledge, raising issues, connecting people.<br>
<br>
<h3>Don'ts</h3><br>
Don't, <strong>ever</strong>, use consultant-speak. Most people will switch off straight away.<br>
Don't block dissent - it will just go underground.<br>
Don't make it hard for people to access the platform. They shouldn't have to go through IT Services to get it unblocked for them.</div><h1>The art of user support</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 22 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#yam<br>
<br>
When I source websites and tools for people, my primary focus is on providing excellent user support. If my clients aren't confident that they will get help at their point of need, then they will not use the systems I'm providing. The more use they get out of the systems, the more likely they are to come back to me for additional work.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/customer_service.001.png"><img src="./assets/customer_service.001.png" alt="User support = empathetic attitudes + supporting processes + consistent communication" title="User support = empathetic attitudes + supporting processes + consistent communication" width="400" height="300"></a></div><br>
<br>
Good user support is made up of three elements:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Empathetic attitudes</li><br>
  <li>Underlying processes</li><br>
  <li>Consistent communication</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
These apply whether you're a single person providing support, or whether you're managing a large IT support desk. If you want to see these principles in action, take a look at <a href="http://www.hostdime.com/">Hostdime</a>. I'm not associated with them, other than I've been a customer of their's for many years. Their support is exemplary.<br>
<br>
<h3>Empathetic attitudes</h3><br>
<strong>Everyone</strong> involved in client-facing work must know what it feels like to be one of your customers. You must understand their expectations, and their levels of knowledge and confidence. For some people, this comes naturally. They're able to put themselves in the situation that the customer's facing and think about it from the client's perpective.<br>
<br>
For others, learning to be empathetic is an ongoing process. Training might help - for example, you could put your systems experts in a situation where they are unconfident, where they don't really understand the language being used, but where they need to get something sorted. Then, use that experience to help them reflect on how their customers feel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Underlying processes</h3><br>
This is the easy part when you're on your own. You choose the tools that work best for you, and there's no problem really if you want to change those tools.<br>
<br>
For example, when working with my (few!) private clients, I use email as the primary communication medium and <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a> as the means of providing quick video How-to's. <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/">TeamViewer</a> is also a great tool for being able to see the client's desktop. But note that it's only free for personal use. You'll need to be doing a lot of support calls to make it worth buying.<br>
<br>
It's when you start to scale up that you really need to think about your processes. As soon as more than one person is involved in the support system then you  will need:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Single points of communication between you and the customer. For your own sanity and the client's ease of use, they should only ever see one email address, one web-support address and one phone number.</li><br>
  <li>A single place where <strong>all</strong> communication records are stored. There are many help desk systems around. <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a> is an excellent example of an off-the-shelf system, but there are others. Whatever you choose, it must be as complex as you need to maintain effective internal systems, but as simple as possible for the client. Your client should not need to learn how to use your support systems!</li><br>
  <li>A means of monitoring, managing and reporting on support calls. This is easier if all your calls are from  email or web. If you have telephone support, you may wish to have some way of recording calls for training and coaching purposes.</li><br>
  <li>Establised internal routes so that calls can be escalated. Ideally, your first line team will have broad skills, so that they can properly evaluate where a call should go.</li><br>
  <li>A means of prioritising calls. This comes down to the client's perception of the importance of the problem, and also the internal reporting that should be showing whether a problem is affecting more than one client.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
There's a lot more detail here that I could go into. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support">Wikipedia article on Technical Support</a> is a good place to start if you want to explore further.<br>
<br>
<h3>Consistent Communication</h3><br>
<br>
With an empathetic attitude and good underlying processes in place, you should have no problem in being consistent in your communication with your customer.<br>
<br>
However, there are three things here that would help you greatly:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A searchable, intelligent knowledgebase - that contains answers to frequently asked questions. It should be regularly updated, and should have both client and internal facing sections. It would suggest possible solutions immediately to the client when they've asked their question. It would also allow internal teams to collaborate on creating answers ready for publication.</li><br>
  <li>Transparent quality control and coaching. We shouldn't be afraid of providing constructive feedback to our support personnel.</li><br>
  <li>Always provide your customers with a means of tracking the call themselves, and of adding further details to their call (usually via email).</li><br>
</ul></div><h1>The state of corporate learning and development</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div class="image_block" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;"><a href="./assets/influences.png"><img src="./assets/influences.png" alt="Various logos of influencing organisations" title="Influences" width="198" height="674"></a></div> Whatever we might like to think, our corporations are not isolated from the surrounding society. In the developed world the brand names, web sites, and tools shown as examples here are playing a major part in how our society operates, consumes, communicates and learns.<br>
<br>
<h3>Key trends in society</h3><br>
<br>
In the past few years, the following seem have been some of the major trends:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Internet use, and particularly broadband (2Mb/s or above) has grown phenomenally. In the UK, in 2009, <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?ID=8">70% of households had access to the internet</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Mobile phone use has grown hugely. In 2008, <a href="http://www.itindustrynews.co.uk/60-of-worlds-population-using-mobile-phones-says-united-nations-873.html">more than 60% of people in the world owned a mobile phone</a>.</li><br>
  <li>When people use the internet to find out something, they usually start with a search engine rather than any particular information source.</li><br>
  <li>Knowledge is being democratised. There is now virtually no barrier - apart from your own time - to start publishing, whether its video, audio, text or even real books.</li><br>
  <li>In a rapidly changing world, any individual or organisation needs to be resilient (able to have alternative ways of doing things), flexible (able to change direction quickly) and maintain good connections (to ensure that you're always up-to-date.</li><br>
  <li>Organisations are losing control of their message. Your customers (and other interested parties) may be pushing alternative messages. They are on an equal footing to you. Just take a look at the short video below:<br>
[youtube]tPgQsv2KPwc[/youtube]<br>
</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Key trends in learning</h3><br>
<br>
Alongside the above trends in society, things are also changing in the world of learning and development:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>We're rethinking the established practice of providing training as a panacea for every performance problem.<br>
<blockquote>"... it's those who consider training as the last resort rather than the first resort who are the engineers of high performance." (<a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/01/30/reflections-on-learning-technologies-2010-lt10uk?blog=5#c1159">Phil Green on this site</a>)</blockquote></li><br>
  <li>We're realising the value of "<a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/handbook/informallearning.html">informal learning</a>". In a 2010 report on managers talking about their own learning:<br>
<blockquote>"the most frequent and effective learning activity is having a chat with a colleague". (<a href="http://goodpractice.com/resources/how-managers-learn-in-their-own-words-white-paper/">How managers learn - in their own words</a>)</blockquote></li><br>
  <li>There is now no excuse for learning and development professionals not to keep up with developments and current thinking. We can attend free international online conferences like <a href="http://learntrends.ning.com/page/learntrends-2009">Learntrends </a>, join in with free webinars such as those provided by the <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/">Learning &amp; Skills Group</a> (invitation required - if you need one, drop me a line), and improve our own management capabilities using the <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics">Manager Tools podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/forums">forums</a>.</li><br>
  <li>There's been a massive growth in authoring tools (see table below for examples). Many are free. And many even allow groups of people to collaborate on a single resource. Some you'll have to install, but some are just websites that you log into.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

Jane Hart has the <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html">best list of tools</a>, both free and paid for, on her Centre for Learning &amp; Performance Technologies site.<br>
</li></ul><br>
<br>
<h3>So where is L&amp;D heading?</h3><br>
<br>
Based on the trends that are happening, I believe that we will see some significant changes in the way Learning &amp; Development operates within our organisations:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>There will be far more use made of low cost, synchronous tools for video-conferencing, instant messaging and web meetings (webinars)</li><br>
  <li>We will move away from the Learning Management System as a delivery tool (see my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/01/30/reflections-on-learning-technologies-2010-lt10uk?blog=5">reflections (and the comments) on Learning Technologies 2010</a>). We are starting to realise (at last!) that learning cannot be managed.</li><br>
  <li>Instead the LMS <em>can</em> play a part in supporting evaluation. But we must remember the maxim: <strong>Make the important measurable, not the measurable important.</strong> This means using the LMS to get more useful feedback from managers about whether performance has improved following an intervention provided by L&amp;D.</li><br>
  <li>There will be a move towards social learning, in particular user-generated content inside the firewall. A number of companies are already seeing great success in this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtVYkEdGtfo">BT</a> and <a href="http://learningwiki.editme.com/322">Cash America</a> are two excellent examples.</li><br>
  <li>Workers inside the firewall will be able to use the learning tools they use (such as Twitter and Facebook) outside the firewall.</li><br>
  <li>Learning will happen across the firewall. Employees will learn from customers and vice versa.</li><br>
  <li>There will be far more use of simulations and serious games. Tools, like <a href="http://www.thinkingworlds.com/">Thinking Worlds</a> will allow "normal" people to create such interventions.</li><br>
  <li>We will start to make more use of the technology people have in their pockets. Social communication tools like Yammer already integrate with SMS (texts). Augmented reality (where your camera picture is overlaid with extra detail from an application) is starting to be seen in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn-zvymlSvk">practical training situations</a>. Just being connected to the internet means that you can always have have access to your performance support materials - whereever you are.</li><br>
  <li>In order to keep up with the rapid changes in society and in your organisations, L&amp;D teams will need to maintain and develop their connections with the business, with research, and with their own personal learning networks.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Increasing Return on Investment</h3><br>
<br>
It's the holy grail... The thing every L&amp;D Manager is looking for... How to prove that what they do actually adds value to the business.<br>
<br>
Up to now, all we've tended to use as our measure of return is how well our interventions are taken up and perceived - how many people attended, how many viewed every page of the online tutorial, how many thought the trainer communicated well, how many passed an assessment straight after they viewed the training materials.<br>
<br>
No-one can legitimately say that these are good measures. They bear no relation to whether an individual has changed their behaviour, or is able to do their job better. They are not measuring performance improvements.<br>
<br>
Yet, that is just what L&amp;D should be about - improving performance. The graphic below illustrates quite clearly that this does not just mean courses. In fact, formal learning is just an off-shoot of the ongoing learning processes that are happening in our organisations. L&amp;D have a role in supporting those processes. Just like a gardener cannot make a plant grow, we cannot make someone learn - but we can provide the environment where learning is more likely.<br>
<div class="image_block"><p>Click on the image for a full-size version</p><a href="./assets/good_practice.com.png"><img src="./assets/good_practice.com.png" alt="Improving performance" title="Improving performance" width="450" height="274"></a><p>Reproduced by kind permission of <a href="http://goodpractice.com/">GoodPractice.com</a></p></div> <br>
<br>
So how do we measure that improved performance? Where do we get our information from?<br>
<br>
From the managers inside the business. They are the people who are closest to what's going on. They are the ones who should be monitoring performance against business objectives, providing feedback and coaching their teams. L&amp;D need to get close to this group of people and act as performance improvement consultants, not just providers of off-the-shelf chunks of learning that may, or may not, work.<br>
<br>
<h3>Learning to learn</h3><br>
<br>
In parallel to the activity around the managers, we need to help our organisation's employees learn better. It's in their own interests - as they'll get left behind otherwise.<br>
<br>
Part of that is to do with the organisation's culture. How far down is responsibility delegated? You can track that by seeing who is allowed to spend money without deferring upwards. The further down it goes, the more likely you are to have a culture of individual responsibility. Which then makes it easier to create a <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/04/10/command-aamp-control-vs-learning-anarchy?blog=5">culture of taking responsibility for personal learning</a>.<br>
<br>
Of course there are problems when you get some people, but not everyone, taking responsibility for their learning:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>They'll make connections with people outside of your organisation - including across the world.</li><br>
  <li>They'll  end up having more in-depth conversations about their professional practice;</li><br>
  <li>These conversations are far more likely to take place with people outside of their organisation than inside;</li><br>
  <li>They will begin to understand that face-to-face events and meetings can be so much more effective if the people involved are part of an existing community of practice (CoP);</li><br>
  <li>They will gradually give up on "traditional" conferences and training events, knowing that they can get better professional development via their CoPs;</li><br>
  </ul><br>
<br>
L&amp;D needs to plan for this.<br>
<br>
So what are the core skills that we need to develop in our employees to help them learn to learn:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Using a search engine to find what they need efficiently</li><br>
  <li>Filtering out the dross, analysing quality and maintaining a trusted network of information sources</li><br>
  <li>Synthesising information into new knowledge, that can be used in new situations</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>

<h3>Summary</h3><br>
<br>
I've covered a lot in this post. But I'd like you to take away these three points:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Make the important measurable, not the measurable important</li><br>
  <li>It's about culture not technology</li><br>
  <li>Start small, think big, move fast (thanks to <a href="http://blogoehlert.typepad.com/">Mark Oehlert</a> for that one)</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Online learning: how not to do it</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 March 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Learning to study as an adult is a tricky process. You have to get to grips with the subject matter of what you're studying. You have to understand which particular referencing styles will work for your particular institution. You have to relearn how to write academic essays.<br>
<br>
Part of the role of the institution is to provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolding</a> that will support the student as they develop their confidence, skills and knowledge. As time goes by, that scaffolding can be removed.<br>
<br>
For now, however, let's just consider what would happen if, instead of scaffolding, you provided experiences that are guaranteed to generate demoralization, frustration and reduced confidence.<br>
<br>
What might those experiences look like?<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>An introductory booklet to your online systems (library and virtual learning environment) that was clearly out-of-date and didn't match up with the students' experiences of those systems.</li><br>
  <li>No clear signposts to get directly to the online library from your university homepage.</li><br>
  <li>Provide links to online library items that are organised by whether they are a book, a journal, a newspaper or a multimedia resource. When you don't know what you're looking for, that's guaranteed to confuse.</li><br>
  <li>Provide links to multiple catalogues and search engines, none of which will actually help you find anything  that you can use</li><br>
  <li>Make sure that the search system you provide (yes, <a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/">EBSCO</a>, I'm looking at you!) is so slow as to be almost unusable.</li><br>
  <li>For any books or papers that you do actually provide online - make sure that they can only be viewed by downloading one page pdf's at a time. (This might work better in IE, if you've got it set up to display pdf's in the browser window - but that's really not guaranteed, and certainly isn't default behaviour in Firefox)</li><br>
  <li>If your student's decide to use systems like they're used to - ie. Google Scholar - don't let them get them get to any of the "private" content. Opt out of the <a href="http://www.athens.ac.uk/">Athens</a> system so they have to come back to your closed library system, which they can't use.</li><br>
  <li>Tell your students that they will have to do lots of reading around their subject.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Follow these simple rules and your success will be guaranteed.<br>
<br>

Worse still, I manage sites for a couple of organisations. They sit on the same <a href="http://www.hostdime.com/">Hostdime</a> server as my blog. Somehow it seems that this server has now got itself blacklisted as one that sends spam, so they're now not getting messages sent through their contact forms.<br>
<br>
Hostdime are looking at it, but I'm not sure what they can do, apart from wait until the message filters through that it's not a spam host.<br>

It's your first time at this particular conference and there's no welcome pack. You can see quite a few people standing around drinking coffee and eating small pastries. But no-one's talking to each other.<br>
<br>
You have three options:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Turn around and walk out.</li><br>
<li>Find someone you know and begin a conversation about one of the conference themes.</li><br>
<li>Introduce yourself to someone you don't know and look for areas of common interest.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Yammer can sometimes feel like that conference room. For many people it's a strange new environment. There are no clear rules on how to behave or what to do. We know the value of networking, but doing that online can be daunting at times.<br>
<br>
So, here are some simple guidelines that may help:<br>
<br>
(NB. In Yammer, as in Twitter, when you "follow" someone, they become part of your personal network and anything they post will appear in your message stream)<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Introduce yourself via your profile. This is the way people will find you, or find out more about you. If you don't write a little about who you are and what you do, then it's unlikely that anyone will link to you unless they already know you.</li><br>
<li>Find people you already know and follow them</li><br>
<li>Add yourself to the organisation chart, and add those people you work with, or for, or those who work for you. It's the quickest way of building the network.</li><br>
<li>If someone you follow posts something, consider replying. Networks are about two way conversations. As soon as a network becomes reliant on a few people pushing out ideas then that network becomes very vulnerable. Strong networks have multiple two-way connections.</li><br>
<li>Once a week or so, consider starting a conversation. Pose a question. Share a link to something useful. Post a document. Think out loud. It doesn't have to be serious. It could even be controversial. As time goes on, the network will become a searchable repository of organisational knowledge.</li><br>
<li>Look out for people from other parts of the organisation with similar interests, and follow them. Some people are very good at linking across different areas. If you follow them, then you're more likely to make your own connections.</li><br>
<li>If you invite someone to Yammer, when they join make sure you welcome them and introduce them to the network. That way the people who follow you will become aware of this new person, and may be more inclined to follow them.</li><br>
<li>If your organisation has a social media policy, make sure you're aware of it. It will protect you and the organisation. If it doesn't, then follow these simple rules:</li><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Remember that anything you write down may potentially become public.</li><br>
<li>Remember that the other names in the network are real people, with real feelings.</li><br>
<li>Text is a great communication medium, but it doesn't convey emotion easily. When you're writing, be aware of how the words may be received. If necessary, use emoticons (like ;-) for example). But don't overdo it.</li><br>
<li>If you only want to communicate with a small, defined group of people, then use email. If you're having a general conversation about something, use Yammer.</li><br>
<li>If you want to keep your conversation inside Yammer, but private to a particular set of people, then consider creating a private group.</li><br>
</ul></ol></div><h1>Ideas for an unConference process</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 April 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#IY10 #yam<br>
<br>
Yesterday, at the <a href="http://www.informatology.com/conference/seminars/unconference/">unconference part of the Informatology conference</a>, I had the opportunity to present some ideas around social software. The style of presentation was a new one on me: <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">Pecha Kucha</a>. Basically, you have 20 slides. They each move on after 20 seconds. And the presenter has to stop after 6 minutes 40 seconds.<br>
<br>
It was the most scripted presentation I've ever done. Each slide had three sentences, and woe betide me if I strayed from the script!<br>
<br>
The presentations were given in 2 groups of 4, with no space for questions or discussion until the end of the whole session.<br>
<br>
To me, the whole thing felt rather unsatisfactory. For a number of reasons:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>I'd tried to put far too much into the presentation. I should have stuck to no more than 3 ideas.</li><br>
  <li>With such a small audience (&lt;20), we could have had some really good conversations, but there wasn't time.</li><br>
  <li>Ideas and questions got lost in the rush through the slides.</li><br>
  <li>In <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/">Clive Shepherd's</a> words, it felt more like "a performance art" than a means of stimulating thought and learning.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, as I do, I've been thinking about how to improve the process.<br>
<br>
It's guided by an underlying principle, that face-to-face time is too valuable to be spent doing stuff that is better done on your own. Face-to-face time should be about conversation. It's through questioning, debate and argument that we then change our opinions and behaviours.<br>
<br>
The diagram below shows a process that I think would work:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/unconference_process.001.png"><img src="./assets/unconference_process.001.png" alt="Unconference process" title="Unconference process" width="500" height="400"></a></div><br>
<br>
Basically, what's happening is this:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The presentation is recorded in advance.</li><br>
  <li>Anyone who's attending the unconference can create a presentation.</li><br>
  <li>To make sure it's not just existing work being resubmitted, the organisers could ask all the presentations to contain the conference logo.</li><br>
  <li>Delegates have the opportunity to view the presentation before the day.</li><br>
  <li>Delegates can rate the presentation as being one they want to discuss or not.</li><br>
  <li>Delegates can raise questions and comments online.</li><br>
  <li>On the day, the conference facilitators prepare some starter questions based on the pre-conference activity.</li><br>
  <li>All the unconference time is spent in conversation. If the delegates wish to view a particular presentation again, then that can happen.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Why Jing &amp; Moodle?</h3><br>
<br>
In thinking about this, my aim was to keep the process as simple and low cost as possible. <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a> is a free tool for Mac or Windows that lets you create 5 minute (maximum) narrated screen-capture movies. It's very basic. There's no editing. And it produces a swf file that will play in any browser. (If you opt for the paid-for Pro version, you can create a file to upload to Youtube. But that's making it more complicated.)<br>
<br>
The conference will need a web site on which to display the movies. <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is the stable, easy to setup, allows access control, will handle self-service uploading, displaying the swf, rating and discussions. There are other tools around that act like a self-contained Youtube site, but these tend to be quite expensive. With Moodle you pay for what you use (in hosting, consultancy, support) rather than a license fee per potential user.</div><h1>Who reads this blog?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 April 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I know I get a lot of hits on this blog, but, apart from the few people that make comments, I've got no real idea of who reads it.<br>
<br>
To be honest, that doesn't matter too much, as I write the blog as a personal learning journal. If other people think it's valuable that's just an added benefit.<br>
<br>
But, it would be nice to know who's out there...<br>
<br>
I've created a quick survey. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to do. I'd be really grateful if you could fill it in. There are no compulsory questions, and I'm not collecting email addresses. Also, I won't use this data for any purpose other than to create some aggregated and anonymised reports. It certainly won't be passed to anyone else.<br>

<br>
Below you'll find the slides I used for last week's <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/04/28/informatology-unconference?blog=5">Informatology unconference talk</a>.<br>
<br>
The whole talk was based on a blog post from last year: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2009/02/23/ten-tips-for-choosing-using-social?blog=5">Ten tips for choosing and using social software</a>. There are more references in the handout (also embedded below).<br>
<br>
I've learnt that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">Pecha Kucha</a> talk needs to have no more than three sentences per slide. So, here's the outline of the script I used. The numbers refer to the slide number.<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Facebook has more than 400 million active users, spending more than 500 billion minutes per month on the site, and sharing more than 25 billion pieces of content every month. That's just Facebook. So why is this relevant to us in the workplace?</li><br>
  <li>Big organisations have "<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/SHGI.pdf">structural holes</a> (pdf)". These limit the organisation's ability to change quickly. The individuals who broker the gaps, who are connected across different groups, play a vital role in generating ideas and making change happen.</li><br>
  <li>If you're the first person with a telephone life doesn't change much. When everyone has a telephone, <strong>and uses it</strong>, then things happen. The value of a network depends on the number of connected users <strong>and the amount of use</strong>.</li><br>
  <li>The half-life of knowledge is decreasing. By the time ideas hit the journals and magazines they are often out of date. So, how do we remain current with accurate, up to date knowledge? By knowing where to look and who to ask.</li><br>
  <li>We've looked at why. Let's look at how. There are many examples of social software implementations not working. The critical thing to remember is that networks rely on individuals. They cannot be managed; only supported. It's a bit like <a href="http://internettime.pbworks.com/learnscapes">gardening</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Will your audience readily adopt social software at work? Are they already using Facebook &amp; Twitter? Do they have blogs? What can you offer them inside that they can't get outside?</li><br>
  <li>Policies protect the individual <strong>and</strong> the organisation. Focus on behaviours that you would like to encourage and promote, rather than on the things you don't want them to do. There are many <a href="http://socialmediagovernance.com/policies.php">examples of social media policies on the web</a>.</li><br>
  <li>You will never compete with Facebook, Twitter etc. Consider, instead, getting them working for you. Sell the benefits to the individual, but don't make them mandatory!</li><br>
  <li>Jane Hart's <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/">directory of tools</a> is up to date and invaluable. Try them out, but be sure to <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2006/05/09/free_stuff_in_a_commercial_world_guest_c?blog=5">check out their business model</a> is you're looking for a long term relationship.</li><br>
  <li>Many people are discovering the benefits of linking up with people outside of the traditional command and control structure. This happens both inside and outside the organisation. The benefits to you, as an individual, are huge. In particular, the abilities to remain current and react to change.</li><br>
  <li>Alongside the social media policy, make sure that people are aware of the personal and organisational implications of not keeping your online presence under control.</li><br>
  <li>Stay under the radar for as long as possible. A big bang launch will lead to unsustainable expectations and long term negativity. Going back to Metcalfe's Law: Density is key. Start small, but be highly focussed. Find an important problem with a small group of users. But <a href="file:///Users/markberthelemy/Google%20Drive/R&amp;D/LearningConversations/andrewmcafee.org/2010/04/drop-the-pilot/">make the system open to everyone from the outset</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Look at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager Tools</a>, <a href="http://moodle.org/">the Moodle community</a> and <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/helpingpeoplelearn/_pfzrpd.htm">Pfizerpedia</a>. Find out what makes them tick. Creating a space for networking is half the job. Consider how you will stimulate the participants to <strong>do</strong> the networking. Be aware of the <a href="http://www.90-9-1.com/">90:9:1 principle</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Where will the data your network generates be stored? Can you get at it? What happens if a free service stops or a company goes bust? Does it matter?</li><br>
  <li>Open source software has seen rapid acceptance over the last few years. If you want the level of control it offers, then look at <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a>, <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">Scuttle</a>, <a href="http://www.dimdim.com/">Dim Dim</a>. There are many other potential candidates.</li><br>
  <li>Over-riding everything else... You need to make friends with your IT team. Make sure they're aware of what you're doing and understand what you're trying to achieve.</li><br>
  <li>Networks are about individuals. Remember that, if it's too hard, or has no perceivable benefit, people will lose interest and go elsewhere. You may need to seed networks with individuals that are already aware of the potential benefits.</li><br>
  <li>The technology's the easy bit. Choosing the <strong>right</strong> technology for your situation, and making it work for you is far harder. Don't be afraid to bring in help. For example, many organisations now employ "<a href="http://www.jarche.com/2009/03/the-community-manager/">community managers</a>".</li><br>
  <li>Phew! Don't forget the handouts...</li><br>

So I raised this question with other ALT members.<br>
<br>
The answers that came back proved that my worries were unfounded.<br>
<br>
Here's a summary of places where you can find research on workplace learning:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/">Towards Maturity</a> - not academic, but worthwhile nonetheless, and the reports are free to download.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://journal.elnet.com.au/index.php?journal=impact">Impact: Journal of Applied Research in Workplace E-learning</a> - looks like exactly what I was looking for. It's free to register and papers are licensed under Creative Commons.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://mature-ip.eu/">Mature</a> - an EU project looking at community driven approaches to learning in the workplace. Just what I need right now!</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
There were a few other suggestions, but they didn't really fit the bill. I was looking for research evidence that I could use to inform my daily practice.<br>
<br>
At the moment, Impact looks most useful.</div><h1>Corporate viral communication</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 May 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>As you might have <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/technology/yammer/?blog=5">gathered</a>, I've been playing with <a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> and other similar tools (like <a href="http://www.socialcast.com/">SocialCast</a>) over the past few weeks and months. In the years I've been working with communications systems, like newsgroups, forums, blogs, wikis etc, I've never seen a tool that's able take off so quickly and easily.<br>
<br>
My experience has mirrored that of <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/03/yammer-will-viral-work-in-the.html">Jim Stogdill</a> (although not with quite so many users):<br>
<br>
<blockquote>... at some point or another someone started a Yammer account based on our email domain. Starting on whatever day that was, Yammer commenced its viral expansion and its spread has really been quite impressive and rapid ...<br>
<br>
... The usage demonstrates all the free-scaling behaviors you'd expect though, so not everyone is yammering away. Still both the growth and the impact have been impressive. We are developing a nice network of the kind of weak connections that tend to "small world" a big enterprise like ours. It's always difficult to quantify the benefits of "soft" collaboration but I'm really happy with what I see and I've personally enjoyed the interactions and my expanded network.</blockquote><br>
<br>
So, what is it about these "Enterprise microblogging" tools that makes their rapid spread happen?<br>
<br>
<h3>Network behaviours</h3><br>
<br>
Most corporations, whatever our org charts show, actually work around networks. Things get done because of who you know. These tools just model that behaviour. They don't try to impose a top-down structure. Connections are made between you and the people that know you. Those people who work across internal boundaries fill in the "structural holes" (<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/SHGI.pdf">See Ronald Burt's paper - pdf</a>) that break organisations into silos. Using these tools allows connections to be made more easily across those holes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Viral delivery</h3><br>
<br>
A virus develops mechanisms that enable it to replicate incredibly easily and quickly, thus providing exponential growth. Viral communication tools do a similar thing. They make it so easy to add new people that it becomes a no-brainer. Like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> (a professional networking tool), both SocialCast and Yammer constantly (but not obtrusively) ask if you want to invite other people. In Yammer, if you enter someone's name into a post (using @name, like Twitter) it will even suggest that you invite that person if they don't already exist in the system. (I expect SocialCast is similar here).<br>
<br>
Online communication tools tend to work in only two situations:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A small, highly focussed group, discussing or working on a particular idea or product, usually with expert facilitation. Eg. Open University course groups</li><br>
  <li>A very large, diverse group, able to talk about anything, but quite often focussed around a particular theme or issue (eg. <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager Tools</a>).</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
The ideal is to get to a critical mass as soon as possible. When that critical mass is reached then the need for ongoing facilitation or marketing is reduced significantly. That's why viral propogation is so essential.<br>
<br>
<h3>Multi-platform</h3><br>
<br>
If a communication tool requires you to <strong>go</strong> to a certain website to send or retrieve messages then you immediately limit your userbase. If you insist on them using a particular browser, then you've put even more barriers in front of them. The thing to remember about online tools is that there's also another one that people can use.<br>
<br>
This is why tools like <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> and the microblogging systems have become so successful. They allow you to access them using whichever platform you have to hand. You might want to receive or send messages using your email client, or by text (SMS), or using an app on your phone, or even via the website.</div><h1>Shortcuts to effective learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 21 May 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you really came here looking for shortcuts to help your children or your employees learn better, more quickly and more cheaply, then I'm afraid you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br>
<br>
What I can help you do is avoid the common things that stop learning happen, or slow down the process.<br>
<br>
Learning takes time and it takes effort - on the part of the "teacher" and on the part of the "learner".<br>
<br>
By learning, I mean the process by which an individual is able to achieve something more quickly, or with higher quality, through gaining a skill, some knowledge, or starting to exhibit a particular behaviour.<br>
<br>
If you do want the best learning possible then there are four factors that must be in place:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Motivation</li><br>
  <li>Help at the point of need</li><br>
  <li>Permission to fail</li><br>
  <li>People to ask</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Yes, you might want to think that your elearning module, your lecture, or even your book is all that is needed. From my experience, I would beg to differ. If you don't have these factors in place, then no amount of "learning resources" will help your people to learn. Don't waste your money.<br>
<br>
If you want to see this in practice, just watch a child learn how to play a computer game. They're not taught how to do it. They'll rarely, if ever, read the manual or watch any of the how-to movies.<br>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3><br>
<br>
Children motivated to get through the game. At first it's just exploration, because the initial marketing did the trick of getting them in the game. Then the game sets small challenges, each one of which is slightly (not too far!) above the current level of skill or knowledge. Competition against a virtual or real adversary can help, but not always.<br>
<br>
So, when we design a learning intervention, we must consider really carefully what is going to get learners there in the first place, and what's going to keep them going when things get hard.<br>
<br>
<h3>Help at the point of need</h3><br>
<br>
If you watch your child carefully, you'll see that the game flashes up hints and tips, just at the point at which they'll be useful. Many games will stop flashing that hint as soon as you start to put it in practice.<br>
<br>
In our learning programmes, then, we need to think about how the learner is going to get the information they need, just when they need it. The more you can do this in practice situations, the less likely they are to need that information in a real situation.<br>
<br>
<h3>Permission to fail</h3><br>
<br>
Our primary method of learning, at least while we're children, is trial and error. Why do we adults think that we've grown out of that? It's all about having a safe way of failing, that's not going to have lasting consequences.<br>
<br>
This is why simulations - both IT-based and face-to-face are so powerful.<br>
<br>
<h3>People to ask</h3><br>
<br>
When a child gets stuck with a game they generally do one of three things:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Give up</li><br>
  <li>Ask a friend</li><br>
  <li>Look up a cheat</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
When we design any learning intervention, we <strong>must</strong> provide access to people. It doesn't have to be an expert, just someone who's a little bit further along the path.</div><h1>Internal communication - learning from the web</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 May 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Good content is great. But good content that no-one ever sees is worthless.<br>
<br>
That's the case with many corporate intranets; pages and pages of stuff that someone thinks is useful or important, but often the messages contained in them just don't get out there.<br>
<br>
What can we (and in particular people developing content management systems) learn from how people use the web in the outside world? If we can work out what drives them to content, then we will get far better use of our internal content.<br>
<br>
<h3>Sort out your search engine</h3><br>
<br>
Many (most?) people won't go to a specific content-providing site to find stuff. They'll search for it. When I'm looking for stuff on my Mac, I'll rarely trawl through the folders. I'll use Spotlight. Ditto with Google Desktop search on Windows.<br>
<br>
Now, let's say you provided a search engine that searched both internal resources and external ones, with internal ones highlighted at the top of the list. Even better if you could provide a way of adding that search engine into your company's default browser, where, normally, you'd just search Google or Bing.<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/search_box.png"><img src="./assets/search_box.png" alt="search box" title="search box" width="257" height="44"></a></div><br>
<br>
<h3>Develop your marketing methods</h3><br>
<br>
If users don't know that content exists, how will they know to look for it? At its simplest, marketing is a global email notifying people of new content that day/week/month. At its most complex, it's like Amazon - emails sent to individuals that highlights specific new (and old) content based on that person's past behaviour on the site.<br>
<br>
Most corporate systems would probably settle for something in the middle of those two extremes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Work with the water cooler</h3><br>
<br>
People recommend content to their friends. "Did you see such and such?" is just part of how we relate to each other.<br>
<br>
If you're using a social-networking/microblogging tool, like Yammer or SocialCast, then consider the potential of having a button next to each item of content that, when clicked, automatically posts "Have you seen [xyz]?" to the user's status? Everyone in their network will then get that message. That's far more powerful, and scalable, than a global email from distant senior management.<br>
<br>
Your aim here is to get people talking about your content. You can't force them to do it, but you can make it easier to do so. Just look at how <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a> does it:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/readcast.png"><img src="./assets/readcast.png" alt="" title="" width="330" height="173"></a></div><br>

Then again, if you're not using social-networking tools, these days you really need to justify why you're not taking advantage of the <a href="http://socialcast.s3.amazonaws.com/corporate/downloads/Socialcast_cookbook.pdf" target="_blank">business benefits they bring</a> [pdf]. Because if you don't provide one, then surely your employees will create one that's under-the-radar - with all the risks that entails.</div><h1>Exporting all your b2evolution posts</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 26 May 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'm going through the process of looking through all my old posts, to see if I can make some sort of coherent resource (perhaps even a book!) out of them.<br>
<br>
I wanted to put them all into a Google Doc where I could pull the text around. I started off just copying and pasting from this blog into the doc, but that was going to take an age with over 500 posts. <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">B2evolution</a> doesn't provide a simple way of displaying all the posts on one page, so I knocked up a quick bit of code to do this.<br>
<br>
It takes every <strong>published</strong> post and displays its title, any associated url, and the content of that post.<br>
<br>
There's nothing fancy about this code; no styling, or proper html commands to set up the page. But it works...<br>
<br>
At the moment it takes every post in your database. There's no way of setting it to only pick up posts from one particular blog (b2evolution lets you create as many blogs as you want). I didn't need that, but if anyone can point me in the right direction I'll add it in.<br>
<br>
To use the code, copy it to a new php file, set up the username, password and database name and add the file to your webserver.<br>
<br>
For safety's sake (and speed), I did this by taking a copy of the database and running the file locally. But you'll need to make sure you've got a webserver, php &amp; MySQL running on your PC/Mac/netbook etc.<br>
<br>
<!-- codeblock lang="php" line="1" --><pre><code><br>

$table = "evo_items__item";<br>
<br>
//connection to the database<br>

echo "Connected to MySQL&lt;br /&gt;";<br>
<br>
//select a database to work with<br>
$selected = mysql_select_db($database,$dbhandle)<br>
  or die("Could not select ".$database);<br>
echo "Connected to ".$database;<br>
<br>
//execute the SQL query and return records<br>
$result = mysql_query("SELECT post_ID, post_title, post_content, post_url, post_status FROM $table WHERE post_status='published'");<br>
//fetch the data from the database<br>
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {<br>
	$content = $row{'post_content'};<br>
	$content = nl2br($content);<br>
	$url = $row{'post_url'};<br>
//	preg_replace('!([\r\n]+)!', '\\\$1', $content);<br>

<br>
It's a term I've never been comfortable with. You'd never ask a writer to create an hour's worth of reading. You'd give them a word limit instead.<br>
<br>
Time measurements are only suitable for passive media, like radio or television, or (in our world) screencasts, podcasts and presentations.<br>
<br>
When you're asking people to actively engage with your medium, or to dip in and out, then time becomes irrelevant.<br>
<br>
What could we use instead?<br>
<br>
It's a tricky one, because good elearning is actually a combination of many different media elements:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Video, audio, animations - measured in minutes and seconds</li><br>
  <li>Text - measured in words</li><br>
  <li>Graphics and images - measured by the number required</li><br>
  <li>Interactions, simulations, games and menus - measured by the number of touch points or branching points</li><br>
  <li>Moderation &amp; support, such as forums, social networks, email - measured by the number of staff and the time they're expected to be monitoring &amp; contributing to <br>
</li></ul><br>
<br>
Don't ever hire an elearning designer who wants to get paid by the word count - the end result will be awful. Perhaps we ought to consider an inverse relationship: the price increases as the word count goes down?<br>
<br>

The message cascades down through the layers until it hits the bottom. We know that this message usually gets diluted, so we come up with strategies to help, like having centrally controlled online or printed content.<br>
<br>
However, this approach can't continue. As soon as people were able to connect with each other independently of the organisation, the hierarchy crumbled.<br>
<br>
The (very) short presentation below illustrates the problem, and suggests a solution. Slide 3 is the interesting one - you could spend some time just looking at the different scenarios that are shown just on that one screen.<br>

<br>
I just wanted to highlight this report that's just been released, from Deloitte (one of the world's largest international accounting and consulting companies.<br>
<br>
It looks at how social media is used internally to drive innovation, and externally to drive customer engagement and recruitment.<br>
<br>
The key section for me is on how they managed the risk:<br>
<blockquote>To participate in social media you must unleash energy not try to control it. The process, technology and policy are easy. Getting the right attitude is hard.<br>
<br>
Deloitte Australia is developing a framework around how to manage social media risk, defining what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, monitoring use and, where appropriate, dealing with it. "In fact, knowing how to respond to an incident, and having a team ready to respond, will be a key." Tommy Viljoen, Risk Services partner and member of the Deloitte Social Media Steering Committee explained.</blockquote><br>

I've been wanting to write a book for a long time now. It's going to take a long time to write it, but I know that if I don't start now I never will.</p><br>
<p>The idea behind it is to take 5 years worth of thinking, reflecting and blogging and crystallise it into something tangible, something that my children can say "Dad made that", something that might be helpful to people who don't interact in the same networked flow of ideas that happen online.</p><br>
<p>I'm planning on writing this publicly. I'll publish each chapter here as it's written, in the hope that the feedback I get will lead to improvements. No idea about publishing at the moment. I might even give it away, but I will definitely get at least one copy printed!</p><br>
<p>To start off then, here are my thoughts on the structure of the book:</p><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
<p>To be written when the rest of the  book is finished.<br><br>Probably will include some element of  auto-biography - my learning journey, philosophy of learning etc.</p><br>
<h2>Section  1: Learning</h2><br>
<p>Most learning professionals, tend to base their work on  gut instinct and past experience. Mention theories like behaviourism  &amp; cognitivism and they'll probably give you a blank look. I'm not  saying I'm an expert, but this chapter will look at some of the key  ideas that underpin the way I think about how we should approach  learning, and provide pointers towards the main theories and models.</p><br>
<h3>Chapter  1: What is learning?</h3><br>
<p>Theories:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Connectivism</li><br>
<li>Constructivism</li><br>
<li>Cognitivism</li><br>
<li>Behaviourism</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>Chapter  2: Why do we learn?</h3><br>
<p>Why do we do anything?<br>Motivations types:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Intrinsic</li><br>
<li>Extrinsic</li><br>
</ul><br>
<div>Link  between teaching and marketing - it's about changing behaviours<br>Motivating  factors:<br><br>
<ul><br>
<li>fear - of now, of the future, of lack of  opportunity</li><br>
<li>punishment</li><br>
<li>reward</li><br>
<li>for personal  interest</li><br>
</ul><br>
</div><br>
<h3>Chapter 3: How do we learn?</h3><br>
<p>Models</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Maslow</li><br>
<li>Vygotsky</li><br>
<li>Scaffolding</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p><br>Memory  and retention<br><br>Learning styles - bite the bullet. Do they really  exist? Look at Coffield's and Romeis' research.<br><br>Formal &amp;  informal</p><br>
<h3>Chapter 4: Where do we learn?</h3><br>
<p>Formal situations -  classrooms, self-study, apprenticeship, teacher-led online programmes<br>Communities  of practice, networks, whilst creating stuff - depends if we choose to  learn, or just do it by trial &amp; error each time</p><br>
<h2>Section 2:  Learning Systems</h2><br>
<p>Systems are good. They take current best practices  and make them replicable across many contexts.<br><br>In the context of  learning, we systematise at our peril. Effective learning has too so  many variables.<br><br>Likewise, we run the risk of failing when our  systems impose new practices on top of ones that already working.<br><br>Yet  systems can still help. Not around learning as a complete process, but  to support specific parts of the process: content delivery, timetabling  of resources, assessments and surveys, breaking down silos, improving  communication etc<br><br>The best systems are simple and flexible. Take  Twitter for example. As simple as it can be, yet used in many different  ways through its API.<br><br>This section will focus on computer-based  systems, as these are most prevalent today. But you could adapt some of  the ideas in it when trying to implement any new way of doing things.</p><br>
<h3>Chapter  5: Types of system</h3><br>
<p>Systematising learning? Is it a good idea?<br><br>Formal  systems:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>fit the timetable/structure of the organisation</li><br>
<li>provide  a means of measurement / assessment</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>Informal systems:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>flexibility  and ease of use are critical</li><br>
<li>must integrate with existing  practices / communication tools</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>Chapter 6: Choosing systems</h3><br>
<p>Analysing  your requirements</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Formal or informal</li><br>
<li>Top down or  networks</li><br>
<li>Who to involve? IT, Risk, Senior Management,  Visionaries/champions (who can see the potential)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>Writing  requirements documents</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Integration</li><br>
<li>Searchability</li><br>
<li>Functionality</li><br>
<li>Usability</li><br>
<li>Accessibility</li><br>
<li>Hosting?  Internal / external</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>Standards:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Data transfer</li><br>
<li>Content  migration</li><br>
<li>SCORM</li><br>
<li>IMS</li><br>
<li>SIF</li><br>
</ul><br>

<p>Implementation issues<br>Encouraging takeup<br>The  role of a community manager<br>Training/CPD for teachers/trainers<br>Working  on the web - writing style<br>Integration issues<br>Change management</p><br>
<h2>Section  3: Learning at work</h2><br>

<p>Clive,</p><br>
<p>Live video streaming from conferences makes the assumption that conferences are all about delivering content.</p><br>
<p>I really don't understand why we've got into this way of thinking.</p><br>
<p>Conferences are the one time when I can have live face-to-face conversations with my peers and experts in the field.</p><br>
<p>If I was in the conference organising business here's what I'd do:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>Get presenters to submit their presentations in advance as a video or narrated Articulate (or similar) package. Perhaps, if I was going for quality, this would be produced professionally, at a video studio, in front of a small live audience</li><br>
<li>Allow access to these presentations to paying delegates, along with a means of delegates raising questions or comment about the materials - that's price band A</li><br>
<li>Ensure that expectations are set for the face-to-face day. It will be about:   <br>
<ul><br>
<li>Conversations</li><br>
<li>Practising skills</li><br>
<li>Coaching</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li><br>
<li>Have a face-to-face conference for delegates (price band B), offering them the chance to meet, in person, with the presenters and to engage with them about the presentations. No video streaming required, as there would be no presentations</li><br>
<li>Ensure that the f2f conference includes sessions for particular interest groups (as happened very successfully at the recent <a href="http://www.learningandskillsgroup.com/events_overview.cfm">Learning &amp; Skills Group</a>)</li><br>
<li>Ensure that people can find each other, perhaps using a social networking / tagging (eg. Elgg) system that allows people with similar interests to get together. This would need a real-world mirror system to help people find each other without having to go around peering at each others name badges. Perhaps some sort of signage on conference tables so that delegates can create a conversation group at a specific table.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>People learn through conversation. So let's build our face-to-face events around that.</p></div><h1>Top 10 tools for learning 2010</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 June 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>Jane Hart is collating her annual list of the tools people use to support learning and development.</p><br>
<p>Here's my contribution. In descending order of importance:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google search</a>. Need I say more? It's fast. I know how to get the best out of it. It's my secondary brain.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. I was a Firefox person, but Chrome is just so much faster. My browser is my gateway to information and to people. It's also where I test any web-based materials I create . Chrome's developer analysis tools are second-to-none.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">Snagit</a>. From Techsmith. Allows you to quickly take screenshots, or just particular windows or parts of the screen, and then to make them look pretty (eg. torn edges, shadows, arrows) quickly and easily. You can even save profiles, so that every screenshot automatically gets the same treatment.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a>. Also from Techsmith. But free. It creates 5 minute (max) videos of your screen activity along with any narration you want to do. There's no editing capability, but for ease of use and effectiveness it can't be beaten. I can't count the number of times I've been able to help people with a quick video that only took 5 mins to produce. Just as if I was showing them in person.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. It's not just a blogging tool. It's great as a content management system. Very flexible, and easy to customise. And with a fantastic <a href="http://www.wptouch.com/">mobile (especially iPhone) interface</a></li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a>. There are other web-based meeting/presentation tools. But Webex is what we have available. It works. It's robust.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>. Flexible. Tried and tested. Teacher/trainer-friendly. And, with Moodle 2.0 coming out, even easier to connect to other Moodle's, repositories and data systems. Hard to beat really.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. The heart of my personal learning network. It's where I go for in-depth thought and analysis from people I trust to deliver.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.trainer1.com/Rapid_Application_Support.html">Context Sensitive Learning</a>. A tool that I push at every opportunity. It acts as middleware between systems that you're trying to get people to use, and the learning content that will help them use it.</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> or <a href="http://www.socialcast.com/">Socialcast</a>. Both very similar, and both work fantastically in large organisations to help break down the <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/SHGI.pdf">structural holes</a> (pdf) that stop ideas spreading.</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Requirements of a corporate learning system vendor</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 1 July 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>Just to be clear, this isn't going to be a list of functionalities. Instead, it's a set of ideals that I would look for from a vendor.</p><br>
<h3>Demonstrable knowledge</h3><br>
<p>Any vendor in this space cannot just dish out software. They need to understand learning, how people interact with software and how organisations will use the software. Part of that will be marketing happy-talk, but it must be more than that. Vendors need to be openly taking part in the conversations that are happening around corporate learning - engaging with the thought-leaders, sharing knowledge, advice and best practice.</p><br>
<h3>Keeping pace with ideas</h3><br>
<p>Given the rate of change in technologies and how they're being used outside the firewall, it's important that any arrangement with a vendor should include ongoing feature updates. If you stand still, then you'll get left behind. This is the strength of the Software As A Service (SAAS) model. Firstly it's far easier to keep the code base up-to-date if it's outside the firewall, and secondly, the these vendors tend to understand the nature of the internet far more than those that just supply software as a product.</p><br>
<h3>Quality support</h3><br>
<p>It really bugs me when I hear about vendors getting away with providing little or no support. As a consumer I value the excellent support I get from companies like <a href="http://www.hostdime.com/">Hostdime</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/TMobileUKhelp">T-Mobile</a>. I don't understand we put up with anything less from our vendors? I've written about the <a href="file:///main/index.php/2010/03/22/the-art-of-user-support?blog=5">Art of User Support</a> elsewhere. I think vendors are allowed to get away with bad support mainly because the people holding the purse strings are not the ones who are asking for help.</p><br>

But, there are times when we put out stuff that's worth talking about. Today's a case in point.<br>
<br>
We've just published a <a href="http://www.capita-ld.co.uk/news/Pages/SkillsGapThreatensUKRecovery.aspx">research report</a> (embedded below), based on the opinions of senior decision makers among the UK’s largest 500 firms.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the findings.<br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The majority (70%) of business leaders fear that inadequate staff skills are the greatest threat to their ability to capitalise on the recovery.</li><br>
  <li>More than two thirds of business leaders admit that their under-trained workforce is struggling to cope with expanded job remits following waves of job cuts during recession.</li><br>
  <li>... as the economy moves out of the downturn, two fifths (40%) of leaders estimate that at least half of employee skills risk becoming obsolete.</li><br>
  <li>Over a third of leaders (36%) lack confidence that their employees have the skills required to deliver the firm’s upturn strategy, with close to half (46%) casting doubt on their L&amp;D department’s ability to provide these learning services.</li><br>
  <li>Over half (55%) claim that their firm is failing to deliver the necessary training for recovery.</li><br>
  <li>Around half fear for their company’s ability to respond to surges in demand (51%), retrain and redeploy people where required (47%) and identify where current skills are becoming obsolete (49%).</li><br>
  <li>More than two thirds (67%) of business leaders are concerned their employees are struggling to cope with expanded remits following job cuts.</li><br>
  <li>More than half (52%) describe their L&amp;D function as slow to respond to the changing requirements of their business during economic turbulence.</li><br>
  <li>As strategic objectives have evolved, close to half (46%) of senior managers report no significant change in the training delivery to their workforce. Going forward, almost as many (43%) expect no significant change to L&amp;D delivery over the next 2-3 years.</li><br>
  <li>The vast majority (82%) of leaders lack confidence that their firm’s L&amp;D strategy and delivery are aligned to the company’s operational strategy.</li><br>
  <li>Half (50%) believe that their L&amp;D function is stuck in a ‘business as usual’ mindset.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
</blockquote> <br>
<br>
You could argue that this data is simply designed to point people towards Capita Learning and Development. That might be partially true. Even so, it's quite clear that L&amp;D in general really isn't hitting the spot where businesses are concerned.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that might be because we still have the mind-set that "learning" is a commodity that we deliver. We provide training to meet perceived training needs. Every performance problem is seen as solved by a training intervention.<br>
<br>
Perhaps L&amp;D needs to rebrand - towards performance consulting... Often performance problems are more around culture, systems, processes and communication. Solve those, and you won't need to provide training in a lot of cases.<br>
<br>
Is there still a place, in today's complex and rapidly changing market, for a learning and development function that just sees itself as a provider of training?<br>

It's all about code. But, if you ever have a single website which you need to rebrand for a specific client, and you can't use a content management system, then here's how to do it.<br>
<br>
Basically, the code looks for a parameter in the URL (eg. www.mywebsite.co.uk?client=myclient), switches to the alternate stylesheet that matches that client name, then stores a browser cookie so that every subsequent page will also use the same stylesheet.<br>
<br>
There are four stages to making this work:<br>
<br>
1) Get a copy of <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>. It's a mature javascript framework that makes it a lot easier to write clever code without having to worry about cross-browser incompatabilities and all the difficult stuff.<br>
<br>
2) Set up two CSS style sheets. You can do more, but let's leave it with just two for now. One is the main one, the other is the alternate. Try not to replicate the CSS too much, as both sheets will be downloaded. So make the alternate stylesheet just have the bits that will need to change.<br>
<br>
3) Create a separate javascript file that will do the switching and cookie setting.<br>
<br>
4) Link the CSS sheets and your javascript into your HTML pages<br>
<br>
Here's the custom javascript you'll need:<br>
<!-- codeblock lang="" line="1" --><pre><code><br>
// Always put this in when using JQuery as IE tends to cache Ajax<br>
$.ajaxSetup ({<br>
    cache: false<br>
});<br>
<br>
// Extend JQuery to get variables from URL<br>
$.extend({<br>
  getUrlVars: function(){<br>
    var vars = [], hash;<br>
    var hashes = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf('?') + 1).split('&amp;');<br>
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; hashes.length; i++)<br>
    {<br>
      hash = hashes[i].split('=');<br>
      vars.push(hash[0]);<br>
      vars[hash[0]] = hash[1];<br>
    }<br>
    return vars;<br>
  },<br>
  getUrlVar: function(name){<br>
    return $.getUrlVars()[name];<br>
  }<br>
});<br>
<br>
// Function to create cookie<br>
function createCookie(name,value,days) {<br>
	if (days) {<br>
		var date = new Date();<br>
		date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));<br>
		var expires = "; expires="+date.toGMTString();<br>
	}<br>
	else var expires = "";<br>
	document.cookie = name+"="+value+expires+"; path=/";<br>
}<br>
<br>
// Function to read cookie<br>
function readCookie(name) {<br>
	var nameEQ = name + "=";<br>
	var ca = document.cookie.split(';');<br>
	for(var i=0;i &lt; ca.length;i++) {<br>
		var c = ca[i];<br>
		while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);<br>
		if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);<br>
	}<br>
	return null;<br>
}<br>
<br>
// Function to delete cookie<br>
function eraseCookie(name) {<br>
	createCookie(name,"",-1);<br>
}<br>
<br>
// Function to switch style<br>
function switchStylestyle(styleName) {<br>
<br>
      // check styles against title attribute - disable all those that don't match<br>
<br>
      $('link[@rel*=style][title]').each(function(i) <br>
      {<br>
         this.disabled = true;<br>
         if (this.getAttribute('title') == styleName) this.disabled = false;<br>
      });<br>
      createCookie('client', styleName, 365); // Set cookie - for a year<br>
   }<br>
<br>
//  <br>
// code to execute when page ready - vital for any JQuery driven site<br>
//<br>
<br>
$(document).ready(function(){<br>
//<br>
//	Set style<br>
//<br>
    var c = readCookie('client'); // Check if this browser already has the 'client' cookie<br>
    var stylesheet = $.getUrlVar('client'); // Check for a variable in the URL<br>
	<br>
    if (stylesheet!=null) { // If there's a new variable in the URL then reset the style<br>
	switchStylestyle(stylesheet);<br>
		} else {<br>
		switchStylestyle(c); // otherwise set it based on the cookie<br>
	  }<br>
	  	  	<br>
 }); // End of Document Ready function<br>
<br>

This post is an attempt to try to mash them together and see what comes out...<br>
<br>
1) I'm reading the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. If there was ever a book that says what I've been thinking - this is it:<br>
<blockquote>Many people in today's world seem to assume that official authorisation is required to learn new things</blockquote><br>
<blockquote>At some point you've got to break down and trust people both inside and outside your organisation.</blockquote><br>
<blockquote>Does your organisation have any genuine passion to share? Can you deal with such honesty?</blockquote><br>
<blockquote>Organisations don't know who their customers are any more.</blockquote><br>
<blockquote>The Net is next to impossible to understand unless you've experienced it for yourself.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I could go on, but I'd probably end up quoting from every page...<br>
<br>
2) Through Twitter interactions with <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyparkin">Tony Parkin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dajbelshaw">Doug Belshaw</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/eylanezekiel">Eylan Ezekiel</a> and a host of other people who have been pushing the boundaries for years, I'm re-engaging with my passion for schools and teaching. We've been saying for years that networks fundamentally change the dynamic of education. That classroom walls can be broken down, that learning is a wider process than that of knowledge transfer from teacher to student. Yet, with all the thinking and fantastic practice that is going on, we still haven't really changed the underlying organisational structures that our schools are based on.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying throw out the baby with the bathwater. But the trouble is, there just isn't the critical mass of networked people in each institution. <strong>What would happen if they all got together to create a new way of doing education?</strong><br>
<br>
3) A similar situation is happening in corporate learning. There are individuals within L&amp;D teams across the country (and the world) who are connecting, learning how to learn and trying to demonstrate how training has to change not just just to keep up with society but to make training better. <strong>What would happen if they got together to create a new way of doing corporate L&amp;D?</strong><br>
<br>
4) We keep having conferences. <a href="http://www.teachmeet.org.uk/">Teachmeets</a> are becoming some of the most valuable CPD events for teachers. Yet very little real change is happening at a structural level.<br>
<br>
5) We have a choice. We either stay inside the current structures and try to change them from the inside or we leave them.<br>
<br>
6) Let's assume, for the moment, that leaving is not an option, so how do we change the current structures? We have to play the game. Use the accepted methods to communicate and make change happen. That means engaging with the regular media and lobbying government (or the management).<br>
<br>
7) So here's a proposal. I'm focussing on schools for now:<br>
<br>
<h3>Education policy conference</h3><br>
<br>
(Thanks to Eylan for his significant input on this)<br>
<br>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: To look at education in its widest sense and propose recommendations for government.<br>
<br>
<strong>Participants</strong>: A mix of 'stakeholders' (eg. teachers, policy-makers, industry leaders, parents, techies, kids!)<br>
<br>
<strong>Method</strong>:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Prepare the ground with a series of prompt statements (see below) - publicised widely and discussed in various media spaces.</li><br>
  <li>Raise the issues of assessment, curriculum, the place of school in society and the home, infrastructure and ethos.</li><br>
  <li>Participants to contribute to a conference wiki under those headings.<br>
  </li><li>Participants to come prepared to a day's conference to discuss, agree, and map out a 5 year plan towards creating a 21st century education system. </li><br>
  <li>The final statement must have three aspects – it must be written for a policy audience, must show stages of development, and must be simple to sum up.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Prompt statements</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The National Curriculum should stay But Ofsted should go</li><br>
  <li>Testing must be rigorous but results should not be published</li><br>
  <li>Schools have a moral and societal obligation to help shape children's lives to be healthy and respectful of authority</li><br>
  <li>If teachers choose resources / suppliers then those choices should be accountable to the community</li><br>
  <li>Classrooms should only be used when absolutely necessary</li><br>
  <li>The government should appoint <a href="http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2010/06/a-nice-for-education-by-karen-whitby/">a Chief Education Officer, and an independent advisory board on education</a></li><br>
  <li>The Open University is a model of highly effective, scalable education that <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/06/ou-key-to-future-of-he.html">could be replicated across schools and universities nationwide</a>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
So, what do you think? Could this work? Would it make <strong>any</strong> difference? Only if it had a high enough profile.</div><h1>Elearning - accessibility and usability</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 July 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>A question was asked today on the <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/forum/topics/accessibility-and-usability">Learning &amp; Skills Group forum</a> about whether elearning has different accessibility and usability standards to normal web design.<br>
<br>
My answer is an emphatic "No!" - at least it shouldn't have.<br>
<br>
The problem is, we (the corporate elearning fraternity) have got so used to our "click next to continue" paradigm, that we've forgotten how people really use the web.<br>
<br>
The accessibility standards for elearning are exactly the same as web design. You need to follow the W3C WAI guidelines and criteria.<br>
<br>
Some useful links:<br>
<br>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ : The source of web accessibility standards. Start with: http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php<br>
<br>
These days, you should focus on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2. See: http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php#whatis2<br>
<br>
http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php : Checks individual URLs or files<br>
<br>
Another web-based tool : http://www.cynthiasays.com/ - There is a paid-for desktop version, which allows checking of whole elearning packages offline: http://www.hisoftware.com/products/accverify.html<br>
<br>
Also, look at the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/webaccessibility/Pages/web_accessibility.aspx">RNIB pages on accessibility</a>, and the <a href="http://www.healthyworklife.org.uk/web_accessibility">Shaw Trust</a>. Both of these provide services that will help you assess your content for accessibility - although the Shaw Trust is more general, as it includes testing with people who don't use a mouse/trackball.<br>
<br>
With usability, there are no hard and fast standards, but, again you should follow general web conventions (which I'm afraid most elearning materials fail spectacularly to do). Jakob Nielsen's site is a good place to start - although follow what he says, not what he does.<br>
<br>
At this point, I'm going to quote from Stephen Downes superb essay on <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/13">Principles of Effective Elearning</a>. It's five years old, but still entirely valid:<br>
<blockquote>Between [Yahoo and Google], designers have hit on what are probably the two essential elements of usability: consistency and simplicity.</blockquote><br>
<br>
How many of our elearning modules and systems can we say have user interfaces that are simple and consistent with web conventions?</div><h1>One to many mobile phone video streaming</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=1082">Leon Cych's post on outdoor video streaming</a> got me thinking.<br>
<br>
I wondered if I could do the same thing with my phone (a Nokia 5800 - their first attempt to compete with the iPhone, now incredibly cheap).<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/item/Top_10_Freeware_for_the_Nokia_5800_XpressMusic_and_S60_5th_Edition.php">All About Symbian has a list of 25 top free apps</a> - one of which is <a href="http://qik.com/">Qik</a>, a live video capture utility.<br>
<br>
It's a three stage process to get started:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Download the app to the phone</li><br>
  <li>Create an account on <a href="http://qik.com/">qik.com</a></li><br>
  <li>Login to your account on the phone (make sure you're using wifi or on an uncapped data rate)</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Hit the <strong>Stream</strong> button and you're instantly streaming video to the qik website.<br>
<br>
I did try using the rear-facing camera to record myself, but the quality isn't up to much. <br>
So you have to use the main camera, which makes it a bit hard to see what you're streaming (as you'll see below!)<br>
<br>
Once the video is finished, it's also available for playback from the Qik site. It can be embedded on any webpage, and sent to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube et al.<br>
<br>
Where can I see this being used in a learning &amp; development context?<br>
<br>
It's fabulous for streaming and recording stuff that is OK to be public. Conferences, public meetings, conversations etc. The sort of things that you'd put onto Youtube. Not so good if you want to restrict access. For that you'll need <a href="https://watershed.ustream.tv/">uStream's Watershed service</a>.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I've no specific application. But it's nice to know it's there when I need it.<br>

Any more?</div><h1>Working efficiently: Word processing</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 4 August 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Some hints and tips to help save time whenever you are using a word-processor (like <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/word/">MS Word</a> or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>) or a desktop publisher (like Serif's <a href="http://www.serif.com/pageplus/">PagePlus</a> or Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>).<br>
<ol><br>
<br>
  <li>If your document is longer than a single page then use "styles". These are really not hard. But they will save you huge amounts of time in formatting and reformatting. Imagine you have a document with a series of headings and sub-headings. Rather than trying to make each one match up, in terms of font, size, line-spacing etc - just create a style for MainHeading and another for SubHeading. Every time you need to make a heading, type the text and then click on the appropriate style.</li><br>
  <li>Use the built-in outline Heading and Normal styles (formatted according to your design). Most word-processors have simple key strokes (<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/general/ShortcutsContent.htm#Styles">examples of Word keyboard shortcuts</a>) that allow you to assign those styles quickly.</li><br>
  <li>Make rapid changes to your document look &amp; feel by changing the formatting of the styles. This will then automatically change any text tagged with a particular style.</li><br>
  <li>Use the <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/documentmap.html">Document Map</a> (Word only, I think) to quickly navigate around large documents. It creates a menu from any text tagged with the outline styles of Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 etc</li><br>
  <li>Never, <strong>ever</strong>, use carriage returns to make spaces between paragraphs. Use the function that adds space above and below paragraphs. Even better if this is used as part of a style, as it will keep your paragraphs consistently spaced automatically.</li><br>
  <li>Use styles and paragraph formatting to control page breaks automatically where ever possible (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/word-help/insert-a-page-break-HA010031062.aspx">Word example</a>). If you put in a manual page break, you will only find yourself having to remove it later if you edit the document.</li><br>
  <li>If you find yourself using the same styles and document structure over and over again, save a bare-bones copy of the document as a <a href="http://wordprocessing.about.com/od/usingtemplatesandaddins/l/blwordtemp.htm">template</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Try to avoid manually adding any repeated formatting to text or to paragraphs that may appear more than once (eg. an italic emphasis to certain words) - unless you can guarantee that you will never want to change that formatting. It's far easier to create a style. That way you can easily change every piece of text with that style.</li><br>
  <li>If you find yourself trying to lay out images and frames on a page, consider using a Desk Top Publisher application instead.</li><br>

For more information see this guide on <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Styles-in-Word-Processing">using styles in word-processing</a>.<br>
<br>
Basically - if you are going to use a Word-processor to do anything more than the odd letter to the bank, you <strong>must</strong> learn how to use styles.<br>
<br>
If there was one thing that I would insist on including in any school ICT curriculum, it would be styles. It then leads into thinking about content reuse, the benefits of ICT, web-design, database design and normalisation and so on.</div><h1>Working towards the perfect learning support system - Jambok</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 August 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I was shown <a href="http://jambok.com/">Jambok</a> recently by the guys at <a href="http://www.fusion-universal.com/">Fusion-Universal</a>. Jambok is a system very similar to <a href="http://www.learningecosystems.com/">Wisetail's Learning Ecosystem</a>, in that it handles media in a social way, and is designed to offer corporate clients the chance to build an internal social media platform.<br>
<br>
The main difference between Jambok and anything else that I've seen, is that it has the recording function (but no editing) built in.<br>
<br>
Let's say you want to create a quick presentation for your team to get across your message. You can either just record yourself via a webcam, or create your visuals using Powerpoint (or <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> or any other visual creation tool) and record yourself talking through the presentation. This should hopefully remove the incentive to have lots of bullet points!<br>
<br>
Then you can do all the normal Youtube/Slideshare/social media stuff of tagging, adding descriptions etc.<br>
<br>
You can see an example of the output below.<br>
<br>
Three areas that I'd like to check out:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Is it possible to prevent embedded videos showing unless the user is logged into Jambok? This might create headaches for risk &amp; security people.</li><br>
  <li>Will Jambok ever be able to take the output of Articulate, Captivate, Exe etc and display that? All it would take is the ability to upload a zipped package (not necessarily SCORMed) and Jambok to unzip it and provide a link to the index.html page. Moodle is the only tool that can currently do this.</li><br>
  <li>Are there plans to incorporate any sort of editing functions?</li><br>
</ol><br>

They are usually deployed into large organisations who need to be able to deploy lots of learning materials to lots of people, whilst controlling access, and recording use.<br>
<br>
The typical corporate learning management system (see note below) contains a catalogue of learning materials, sometimes tailored to specific roles. These materials are in the form of SCORM content packages (see <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM Warning</a> for more information on SCORM).<br>
<br>
So, what does the LMS offer to businesses?<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A single repository for learning materials</li><br>
  <li>A place where learning materials are mapped to roles</li><br>
  <li>Automation of training interventions, eg. you must pass by a certain date</li><br>
  <li>A means of tracking which materials have been used and "passed", by whom</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
And what does it offer to learners?<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A single place to go to for learning materials</li><br>
  <li>All the learning materials for my role</li><br>
  <li>Automated reminders of what I need to do for my job</li><br>
  <li>A consolidated record of the learning interventions I have undertaken</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
At least, that's the theory.<br>
<br>
Seeing how people really use the internet to support their learning, let's look at it another way.<br>
<br>
You could analyse learning needs like this:<br>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>The organisation knows the answers</strong></td>
<td><strong>The organisation doesn't know the answers</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The learner knows the answers</strong></td>
<td>No need for learning</td>
<td>The learner should share the answers with the organisation - eg. blogs, enterprise micro-blogging, wikis, internal Youtube etc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The learner knows they don't know the answers</strong></td>
<td>Use an internal search engine to find the organisation's view on things</td>
<td>Ask questions on an internal forum / social networking site to see which colleagues know the answers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The learner doesn't know they don't know the answers</strong></td>
<td style="background-color: #eeee10;">The learner needs to be directed towards the answers. There is a case here for the LMS (eg. compliance, induction, process changes etc), but supported by effective internal communication, and searchable reference material.</td>
<td>The organisation needs to hope that someone near the learner will be able to help!</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
There is only one space in this analysis (highlighted) where an LMS might be vaguely applicable. Yet that accounts for most of the investment in learning within our organisations.<br>
<br>
Most people, when they know they need to learn something, start with a search engine. Usually that search engine already knows quite a bit about the individual, and can immediately make recommendations about what they should be looking at. So, how about a system that knows your role, makes recommendations on current induction and compliance materials, and then lets you find the rest of the stuff you need?<br>
<br>
The trouble with that approach, is that anything that is locked inside a SCORM wrapper is stuck inside a SCORM wrapper. No search engine will ever be able to find it. And, even if it could, wouldn't be able to link to a specific page inside it. (That's one of the warnings I missed out on my SCORM Warnings post!)<br>
<br>
This means that, however good the content is, your learners will be unlikely ever to a) find it again, or b) use it to refer to. They are reliant on the LMS provoking them to revisit the materials, rather than their own need or curiosity. So, it turns out, that it's the LMS (+SCORM) that is blocking learning.<br>
<br>
As an example, I know at least one government agency where employees learn about internal processes through Google searches that lead to client-facing materials, rather than through their internal learning materials which are inside the LMS!<br>
<br>
All the time we have LMS's, organisations will feel bound to continue to put content inside it that should, instead be sitting elsewhere, in a searchable (and thus findable) state.<br>
<br>
So, my call is for organisations to think more strategically about their learning materials. Consider where they should be best placed for most effective long term gain, and perhaps even closing the LMS to new materials...<br>
<br>
<h3>Note</h3><br>
<br>
Corporate learning management systems differ hugely from academic learning management systems (aka virtual learning environment: VLE). Generally, the academic system is based around courses, tutors and discussion, and less around content. However, too many tutors simply use their system as a means of distributing content... but that's another post...<br>
<br>

Long live the King!</a></div><h1>If I was in charge ...</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 August 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>On the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=2966423">21st Century Learning Skills LinkedIn Group</a>, Rhys Brookes recently asked the question:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>You have a blank canvas, no limitations, it's your company.. How would you ensure knowledge and best practice was shared amongst colleagues? And how would you bring new and existing staff up to speed in the shortest time possible?</blockquote><br>
<br>
This is something I've been thinking about for a while. My first reaction would be to get rid of any existing training department... At the moment, most training departments are in the commodity business. They are measured by how many classroom courses they deliver or how many times their elearning course is accessed.<br>
<br>
That can not be a good model for providing effective training and learning support to the business!<br>
<br>
Secondly, I'd start a new department called "Performance Improvement", who's remit is to:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>look at what the organisation needs</li><br>
  <li>look at what learners need</li><br>
  <li>look at what the organisation can offer</li><br>
  <li>look at what learners can offer</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Thirdly, I would make friends with the IT department and any Risk &amp; Compliance managers in the business. Their buy-in will be critical.<br>
<br>
Fourthly, I'd be looking at:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Implementing feedback and coaching practices along the lines of those promoted by <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">www.manager-tools.com</a> - I haven't found anything else that makes so much sense.</li><br>
  <li>Systems that will help learners to find resources quickly. Probably based around a central search system, supported by an organisation managed content management system, a social networking / micro-blogging tool like SocialCast, a social media tool like Jambok, and an IT support tool like Trainer1's Context Sensitive Learning. The precise balance and choice of systems would depend greatly on the type of work people do.</li><br>
<li>Working with Internal Communications to create a joined-up ongoing performance improvement &amp; communications strategy / process</li><br>
  <li>Working with the IT Helpdesk, to ensure that the advice they give is shared within our user-searchable systems.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fifthly, I'd look at where there is a specific need for formal learning interventions, and work out the best approach for each one.<br>
<br>
And finally, I'd look at implementing a Learning Management System (LMS). How can I say that, given <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die?blog=5">yesterday's post</a>? Well, I've been persuaded, by <a href="http://ryan2point0.wordpress.com/">Ryan Tracey</a>, that there is a role for the LMS. It's not about delivering content. Instead, the LMS is there for the sole purpose of assessment. Forget compliance "courses" that tell you stuff and then test you on it straight away. From a learning point of view that's an expensive waste of time. Most of that knowledge will be lost after 20 minutes. Instead, focus on making sure your assessment is rigorous and meaningful. Point your employees towards relevant content if necessary, and give them as many times as they need to complete it.</div><h1>Free Our Content</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 August 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>As <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/16/if-i-was-in-charge?blog=5">I wrote earlier today</a> and <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/06/courses-and-content?blog=5">also back in 2008</a>, I believe that Learning Management Systems are <strong>not</strong> the place to be locking away content.<br>
<br>
To get the full return on investment, content should be placed somewhere that search engines (whether internal or external) can find and index it. (BTW. That probably means we need to rethink our dependence on Flash as a delivery mechanism for elearning content too...)<br>

Some of the results appear almost miraculous. They are discussed in detail in his recent BJET paper: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01077.x/abstract">Limits to self-organising systems of learning—the Kalikuppam experiment</a>. (It's a pity that, for a Becta-funded journal, you still need a paid subscription!)<br>
<br>
He talks about the "granny effect" - having someone looking over the child's shoulder, asking questions about what they're doing, and enthusing about it.<br>
<br>
I loved his description of the model he used in Gateshead:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Four children working together on a computer.</li><br>
  <li>Children can change teams.</li><br>
  <li>No child should work alone.</li><br>
  <li>Children can observe other teams and bring back knowledge to their own team.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Has anyone seen this model working in their classrooms?<br>

Thanks to <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2010/sugata-mitras-new-ted-talk/">Will Richardson</a> for pointing this one out.</div><h1>Dilbert on social media</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 September 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I couldn't resist...<br>
<br>
<a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2010-09-13/" title="Dilbert.com"><img src="./assets/100155.strip.gif" border="0" alt="Dilbert.com"></a></div><h1>Why would anyone want to buy IT training?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 20 September 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There are two types of IT training:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>What can I do with this software?</li><br>
  <li>How do I get this software to do what I want?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Now, if the software is well-designed, has context-sensitive help embedded within it, and a good, user-focussed, reference guide, there should <strong>never</strong> be any need for specific training about how to make it work. Yes, there's space for people to learn hints and tips, or to find help to solve problems (especially with complex tools like Excel &amp; Access), but, to be honest, all this is available for free on the web, so why buy it in?<br>
<br>
In the real world, most software is not well-designed, does not have context-sensitive help, and lacks a good reference guide. But again, for the more popular packages, like MS Office, there's so much "How to" material available on the web, why buy it in?<br>
<br>
The main role for IT training should be to support: "What can I do with this software?"<br>
<br>
This is where training will add the most value. Start people off on a path, showing them how the software can help solve their particular problems. Forget the how-to's. That can be solved through providing resources and allowing users to raise questions of other users. It's the "Why" question that's the real blockage.<br>
<br>
So, here's my starter-for-ten for an IT implementation training plan:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Identify the champions - people who already can see the benefits.</li><br>
  <li>Provide tools to the champions to enable them to share their knowledge quickly and easily. eg. <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing/">Jing</a> for creating how-tos, plus a  knowledgebase (based on a simple content-management system) to share the how-tos. (Or even better, an integrated tool that does it all in one, like <a href="http://jambok.com/">Jambok</a>, discussed <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/06/working-towards-the-perfect-learning-support-system-jambok?blog=5">earlier this year</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Provide a support forum, or helpdesk tool, where users can ask questions.</li><br>
  <li>Provide a support-desk, who's function is to answer the support forum. They can also add items to the blog.</li><br>
  <li>Provide a way for users to subscribe to new knowledgebase articles.</li><br>
  <li>Ensure that managers are signed-up to the benefits of the new software</li><br>
  <li>Provide questions for managers to use in their regular one-to-ones with staff that help to move people on in their use of the new software</li><br>
  <li>Provide facilitated workshops for staff to help explore what the software can do for them. Keep pointing staff to the self-help materials for answers to how-to questions.</li><br>
  <li>Identify further champions from the trainees, and suggest they also use tools like Jing to share their knowledge.</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Project Initiation Questions</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>In my experience, and that of others I talk to, a lot of training projects and programmes flounder simply because the right questions were not asked at the beginning.<br>
<br>
The list of questions below is not exhaustive, but covers the main areas that you would (ideally) want to discuss with a potential client before even putting in a costed proposal. It comes from conversations on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and the <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/forum/topics/initial-questions-for-a-client">Learning &amp; Skills Group forum</a>, as well as personal experience.<br>
<br>
Remember, though, that it's not enough just to ask the questions. You need to ask the right people, and have the right people doing the asking. Otherwise you'll end up with a series of answers that are no use to anyone. Many of the answers to these questions will also lead to further questions, so don't skimp on the time you allow for this process.<br>
<br>
I've grouped them roughly according to the type of knowledge, to help identify suitable people to have the conversations. There is some overlap, so you will find the questions replicated in some cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Performance Improvement</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>What measurable business goal are you aiming to achieve through this learning programme?</li><br>
  <li>Do you expect people to work through this once only? If so, are you aware that most of what we read is forgotten within 20 minutes? If not, then how will people find the information again? (NB. Locking information out of sight is <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die?blog=5">what an LMS does best</a>)<br>
</li><br>
  <li>What information do you need to gather to check whether you have reached your goal?</li><br>
  <li>What do your high-performing people already do that helps the organisation to achieve your measurable business goal?</li><br>
  <li>How will you assess whether performance has improved?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Strategy, Management and Culture</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>How will learners find out about this learning programme?</li><br>
  <li>What motivational factors will encourage learners to engage with the learning programme?</li><br>
  <li>Who are the learners? Why do they need to undertake this learning programme? What's in it for them?</li><br>
  <li>What barriers or constraints will prevent the learners from engaging with the programme?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Systems</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Do you wish to control access to the materials (inside the organisation, from outside the organisation)? Do you have an existing system to handle this?</li><br>
  <li>Do you need to be able to edit the content at a later date?</li><br>
  <li>Do you wish to use audio or video? If so, where will this be hosted (eg. internally, Youtube)?</li><br>
  <li>Does the user-facing systems need to be tested and verified for accessibility and standards compliance? If so, against which standards? Do you require independent testing? </li><br>
  <li>What will be the process by which a learner gains access to this programme? (From not knowing anything to beginning to engage)</li><br>
  <li>Do you have a Learning Management System that will accept SCORM packaged materials? If not, where will the materials be hosted, and how will access be controlled (if required)? </li><br>
  <li>Do all your learners have access to the internet?</li><br>
  <li>Do all your learners have access to your intranet?</li><br>
  <li>Where will people access the materials? Home? Work? Desktop? Mobile?</li><br>
  <li>How will you assess whether performance has improved? Do you have an LMS or similar to help handle this?</li><br>
  <li>Which elements, if any, of the SCORM specification do you require to be implemented: content packaging, metadata, run-time? (See: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM Warning</a>)</li><br>
  <li>How often will you need to update the content of the materials? </li><br>
  <li>Do you expect people to refer back to this material whilst doing their job? If so, we may need to include search and additional navigation elements to aid this (similar to the contents and index pages of a book). </li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Content design and build</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Do you wish any online materials to be personalised by the user? eg. font size, colour, widgets</li><br>
  <li>Do you have any published style and branding guidelines?</li><br>
  <li>Do you have a large (500+ photo) image library? If not, can we use a stock library?</li><br>
  <li>Do you wish to use audio or video? If so, where will this be hosted (eg. internally, Youtube)? What functions are required – pause/rewind/select chapters/volume control /close captions?)</li><br>
  <li>Are you happy for users to scroll to find additional information? </li><br>
  <li>When viewed on a normal desktop or laptop computer, what is the minimum screen width we should design against?</li><br>
  <li>Do you need to be able to edit the content at a later date?</li><br>
  <li>Can your learners view Flash based content? Which version of Flash?</li><br>
  <li>On which browser(s) (and versions) should the learning materials work?</li><br>
  <li>Does the learning content need to be tested and verified for accessibility and standards compliance? If so, against which standards? Do you require independent testing? </li><br>
  <li>A typical learning resource is structured as follows: Programme -&gt; Modules -&gt; Units -&gt; Pages. How many modules, units and pages will be required? </li><br>
  <li>Where will people access the materials? Home? Work? Desktop? Mobile?</li><br>
  <li>How will you assess whether performance has improved?</li><br>
  <li>How often will you need to update the content of the materials? </li><br>
  <li>Is this module part of a wider set of modules? If so, and if you expect people to refer back to this material, then they should be built as a single package, with integrated navigation and search. <br>
</li><br>
  <li>Do you expect people to refer back to this material whilst doing their job? If so, we may need to include search and additional navigation elements to aid this (similar to the contents and index pages of a book). </li><br>
  <li>Remembering that most people do not like to read on-screen, why deliver this as an online programme, rather than a downloadable document which can be printed?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Project Management</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Who will be responsible for signing off each stage of the project?</li><br>
  <li>How much time will this person have available to work with the project team?</li><br>
  <li>Who is your subject matter expert?</li><br>
  <li>How many layers of management require to be consulted before each sign-off?</li><br>
  <li>When do you need this learning programme to begin?</li><br>

We carefully craft our materials so they're engaging and follow best practice in materials design. Our developers create code that is standards compliant and accessible.<br>
<br>
In theory, we've done everything we can to maximise the impact of our materials.<br>
<br>
Yet we can still do more...<br>
<h3>1. Make them easy to get to</h3><br>
Cut down the number of authentication steps required to the bare minimum. None at all if possible. Each time a user hits a page asking for a password it reduces their motivation to continue.<br>
<br>
Similarly, make sure that the system holding your materials is as user-centred as possible. Relevant materials should not be hidden deep within systems that you have to learn to navigate. That's the beauty of hyperlinks. A link can be placed where the user is to take them straight to the materials.<br>
<br>
<h3>2. Make them easy to find</h3><br>
The starting place for most people when they need to find something out is a search page. Ideally, your materials will be on the open internet and viewable to a normal search engine. If that's not possible, and they need to stay inside the corporate firewall, then at least make them visible to the corporate search engine (you <strong>do</strong> have one, don't you?)<br>
<br>
And by making them visible to search engines, I mean the whole package, not just the title page, but all the content inside. Obviously that's not yet possible with video or audio files. But if you've got text-based pages, then all that text should be searchable, so a user can jump straight to it when needed.<br>
<br>
<h3>3. Make them easy to refer</h3><br>
Ideas spread around the internet through people making referrals via email, twitter, blogs, social bookmarking, social networks, recommendations etc.<br>
<br>
Your materials should all have a unique (and permanent) URL that can be shared. Even better, each individual page within the materials should have its own URL.<br>
<br>
When users get to your content, they should be able to rate it, make comments, tweet it (or use an internal micro-blogging tool - again, you do have one?) and invite other colleagues to view it. It's called viral marketing, and it works on the web. Why don't we use it in our organisations?</div><h1>Don't lecture me - Donald Clark ALT-C 2010 keynote</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 October 2010</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you get a chance and work in formal education, watch this challenging talk from <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/">Donald Clark</a>.<br>
<br>
It stimulated a lot of dialogue (exactly what a <strong>lecture</strong> should do), during the talk on Twitter, and afterwards, both on <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/09/tweckled-at-alt_10.html">Donald's blog post</a> and elsewhere (eg. <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2010/09/11/a-response-to-donald-clarks-altc2010-keynote/">Doug Belshaw's</a>.<br>
<br>
Donald's been debating the merits of lectures for years, it's probably a good idea to look at these posts to get some background:<br>

http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2009/10/universities-recorded-lectures-better.html<br>
<br>
Some key points to take away from the discussion:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The lecture is the default - so we need to abolish the job description: "lecturer".</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a> (and lots of other models in current use) only survive because they are easy to put on a Powerpoint.</li><br>
  <li>If you're going to stand and broadcast - then do it proprly - make them good, and at scale.</li><br>
  <li>"We don't need lectures, we need performers who turn learning into a live and enjoyable experience".</li><br>
  <li>The lecture is not a good method for promoting critical thought.</li><br>
  <li>A lecture should be as long as it needs to be. Why is an hour the default?</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.turning-talk.com/mazur/article-intro-jun09">Mazur's work at Harvard</a> with undergraduate physics is a good model to look at for a new way of approaching "instruction".</li><br>
  <li>Using lectures as a basis for learning makes no reference to current research in how people learn. eg. learning by doing, spaced practice, collaborative.</li><br>
  <li>Why do we go to conferences, when we can get what we need online?</li><br>

<p>What follows is an update of a post I wrote back in 2005 about <a href="file:///main/index.php/2005/11/24/things_to_consider_when_designing_learni?blog=5">what to consider when designing learning programmes.</a> As "Learning Designers", once we've asked the right <a href="file:///main/index.php/2010/09/22/project-initiation-questions?blog=5">questions at the outset of the project</a>, we need to get down to the iterative process of coming up with a solution.</p><br>
<p>At the outset, a whole range of potential solutions are available to us. As we start to work through the constraints and the requirements, many of these possibilities will become less viable. Eventually we'll end up with a small number of possible solutions.  I'm going to describe the filtering process in the way that I often approach it. Others may do things in a completely different order, but we'll all have to deal with the same issues.</p><br>
<h3>Context</h3><br>
<h4>Culture</h4><br>
<p>I'll need to understand the culture of the organisation I'm working with. Often that means some very difficult meetings where all I seem to ask is "Why?"  If you don't dig into what makes the organisation tick, then you're missing a hugely important part of the jigsaw that is a successful learning programme.</p><br>
<p>Find out what drives people to perform well. How do they gain recognition, promotion, pay rises? What motivates them?  Find out about the management culture? Do they use frequent coaching and one-to-one sessions about individual performance? Where does management focus its effort? On sales? On product development? On personal performance? On outputs?</p><br>
<p>Find out what really works as regards learning... If at all possible, don't just rely on the HR and L&amp;D people to tell you. Try to talk to the managers, or even (heaven forbid!) the people who will be affected by the programme.</p><br>
<h4>Infrastructure</h4><br>
<p>What basic infrastructure is already available that can support learning?  Is there an organisational IT network? Does it work at useable speeds? Are there times when it can't be used effectively? Is it just for storing files, or does it also have applications like a content management system, email, calendars, micro-blogging etc?</p><br>
<p>Can your potential learners break out of the network and use the internet? What restrictions are placed on their use of the internet?</p><br>
<p>Does the organisation use telephone conferencing? Does that include capabilities to host online meetings that use desktop sharing, presentations, video, chat etc?</p><br>
<p>What facilities are available for holding face-to-face meetings? What sizes of rooms are available?</p><br>
<h4>Management</h4><br>
<p>This comes down to time and money really. Will the managers be supportive of the learning programme? Will they allocate time for people to do it properly? Will they be prepared to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the programme? Who is paying for the learners to take part in the programme? Who has the money invested in it?  Can you even find out who the managers are?</p><br>
<h4>Learners</h4><br>
<p>We're always exhorted to know our "audience" before trying to teach them. Is there someone you can work with who knows the daily life of the people you're trying to teach? Can you plan in some time to work with them for a day or two?</p><br>
<p>Can you build up a picture of a "typical" learner or two? It's really useful to have these pen portrait <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(marketing)">personas</a>, as it then helps as model to test your ideas against. NB. I linked to the Personas (marketing) article on Wikipedia, as it's my belief that learning and marketing have similar objectives (to change behaviours).</p><br>
<h3>Objectives</h3><br>
<p>All the time, while you're finding out about the culture of the organisation, you need to be thinking about the objectives of the programme. Ideally these will be measurable objectives - things that the organisation is trying to change through your programme.</p><br>
<p>Hopefully you've not yet got yourself into a position where you've already told the client what you're going to deliver...</p><br>
<h3>Activities</h3><br>
<p>Learning is about doing, about engaging with content and people. So that's where I start - by considering what activities I am going to ask my learners to do. It's a hangover from my teaching days - my planning sheets always had a space to record the activities the children (and I) would do at each stage in the lesson. Only then could I plan what resources I'd need to support those activities.</p><br>
<p>The activities that your learners will do will be influenced strongly by the ways you believe people learn, and also by the context in which the learning is to take place (see above). So, to do this, you'll need to have a reasonably good idea of the different theoretical models of learning (eg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviourism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitivism_(psychology)">cognitivism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)">constructivism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism_(learning_theory)">connectivism</a>) and which one is the best fit for your situation.</p><br>
<h3>Resources</h3><br>
<p>The activities you choose will need resourcing, maybe with personnel, with an environment in which they are to take place, with media, or with design tools with which to create or aggregate new media. Your choice will be influenced by the context in which the learning is to take place, particularly the existing resources already available to you.</p><br>
<p>At this point you'll also need to look back at the context and constraints you're working under. From here on it becomes an iterative process to get to the best (not always the ideal) solution.</p></div><h1>What did <del>the Romans</del> ICT do for us?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>[youtube]ExWfh6sGyso[/youtube]<br>
<br>
In our schools, ICT is often held up as an example of modern thinking - an essential for today's classroom. Yet what real benefit has the massive investment in ICT infrastructure really brought?<br>
<br>
<a href="http://rogerbroadie.wordpress.com/">Roger Broadie</a>, a number of years ago, developed a model that examined the strategic benefits that ICT can bring to a school:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><br>
<a href="./assets/broadie_model.png"><img src="./assets/broadie_model.png" alt="Roger Broadie model" title="" width="659" height="213"></a><br>
<a href="http://www.eep-edu.org/InnService/Start/what_addval_start.htm">Added value of ICT for learning</a><br>
</div><br>
<br>
We may be seeing some of these, in a small way, with certain enthusiastic teachers, or in a whole-school way when the senior management are really switched on and ready to take the plunge. But it's hard to find examples where real, systemic and long-lasting benefits are being seen that would justify the spending.<br>
<br>
Ian Yorston discusses this in his <a href="http://www.atl.org.uk/publications-and-resources/report/report-2010/feature-schools-ict.asp">recent article for ATL</a>, but his conclusion is to just start using the technology that the children bring to school. I'm in agreement there in principle, but like <a href="http://advisorymatters.naaceblogs.org/2010/10/09/using-the-kids-kit-is-not-the-solution/">Gareth Davies</a>, can't see it working in practice.<br>
<br>
My conclusion is somewhat wider reaching. We either stop spending, and accept that, at the moment, there's no real need for ICT in our schools, or we change the way we do education so that ICT can be used to its full potential.<br>
<br>
I know many, extremely good, teachers who cannot see why they should use ICT at all. They get the results that the schools need (in terms of SATS and GCSE scores). Why should they have the hassle of bringing in something that they are not confident in?<br>
<br>
Yes, OFSTED demands it, but why? What is ICT adding to these teachers and their students?<br>
<br>
If we are to see real benefits, I'm with Sir Ken Robinson... <a href="http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/bring-on-the-learning-revolution">we don't need evolution, we need revolution</a>.<br>
<br>
Let's take some parts of Roger Broadie's model, and use it to help us rethink what we mean by education:<br>
<br>
<h3>Improve access to resources</h3><br>
<br>
Our children have access to far more resources (written, audio, video, animation <str>and</str> people) than we ever did. Yet do we teach them how to plan, how to search, how to evaluate, how to criticise, how to sythesise ideas, how to create and share new resources? What about copyright, creative commons, providing references? This should start in primary school. Not in my experience it doesn't.<br>
<br>
With this wealth of resources freely available, why do we still insist on exams that rely on memory? Shouldn't we be assessing something deeper than just the ability to recall a quote?<br>
<br>
<h3>Extend learning time and provide replicability and scaleability</h3><br>
<br>
The school year, divided into terms, with long summer holidays, and school days, divided into hour long lessons are artificial constraints (just as is the working day for adults - but that's another post).<br>
<br>
ICT should enable us to free things up. Should enable us to learn when and where we need to for particular topics/activities. I have only ever come across one example of this - schools in Coventry that got together to deliver A-level English using a combination of video-conferencing, online resources and discussion forums. This was in 2003! Why isn't this the norm now? We have superb reference examples in the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> and various Online High Schools in the US (eg. <a href="http://epgy.stanford.edu/ohs/">Stanford OHS</a>. <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/10/faceless-schools.html">Donald Clark makes a persuasive argument</a> to use ICT to its full capacity to scale up learning.<br>
<br>
<h3>Increase communication</h3><br>
<br>
This is probably the one area where schools are starting to change. In particular, they are using their websites and the management information systems to provide portals for parents.<br>
<br>
But again, is that far enough?<br>
<br>
How many schools have Twitter and Facebook (or whatever comes along next year) accounts? How many know that it's possible to automatically get their school news published on both Twitter and Facebook? Why does news only get published on a printed newsletter once a month? Why not as it happens?<br>
<br>
Similarly, are we introducing our children to the idea of developing a <a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2008/02/my-personal-learning-network-in-action.html">personal learning network</a> - an evolving, constantly refined group of people who share ideas and resources, and respond to questions? The technology's there to allow this to happen. But are our schools ready for it?<br>
<br>
There's a lot more to be done to allow ICT to play its full part in our education system. But, all the time our political system is dominated by people who expect education to happen in the way it was done to them, there is really very little point. We might as well stop wasting our money. What do you think?</div><h1>Being Creative in a Digital World</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>This post is aimed at participants in my forthcoming workshop on Creative Thinking in a Digital World - please <a href="file:///main/index.php?blog=5&amp;disp=msgform&amp;recipient_id=3&amp;redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learningconversations.co.uk%2Fmain%2Findex.php%3Fblog%3D5">contact me</a> if you'd like me to run a similar workshop for your teams.</p><br>
<h3>Prework exercises</h3><br>
<p>Before the workshop, you will need to have watched at least one of the two videos below. They are both from the same event - a lecture by <a href="http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/">Sir Ken Robinson</a>; the first is an abridged, 11 minute version of the talk, with supporting animations. The second is the entire 55 minute talk.</p><br>
<p>While you are watching the video consider:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>What do we mean by creativity?</li><br>
<li>What is divergent thinking?</li><br>
<li>Why is collaboration important for creative thought?</li><br>
</ol><br>

<p>[youtube]mCbdS4hSa0s[/youtube]</p><br>
<h3>During the workshop</h3><br>
<p>The workshop is designed to&nbsp;as interactive and practical half-day workshop which will allow you to develop ways in which you can use the digital space to stimulate creativity, generate ideas, solve problems and learn.</p><br>
<p>We will explore&nbsp;<span>how to create a <strong>personal learning network</strong> through which you can remain current, stimulate new ideas and adapt rapidly.</span></p><br>
<p>This will focus on the use of blogs, RSS feeds, Twitter, Facebook and, in particular, the way mobile devices enable us to remain connected at all times.</p><br>
<p><span><span>We will then identify a number of <strong>tools </strong>that can support ideas generation, discussion and collaboration.</span></span></p><br>
<p><span><span>This will focus on a range of tool-types including:</span></span></p><br>
<ul><br>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind-mapping</a> /&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">Concept-mapping</a></li><br>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">Enterprise micro-blogging</a></li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>You will leave with a set of tools to explore, along with ideas on when and where they might be useful, and the implications of using them.</p><br>
<p>Finally we will explore how to use <strong>digital media</strong> to find and evaluate information, collaborate more effectively, create ideas and communicate.</p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We will look at questions such as:</span></p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>How do you know whether something is worth buying?</li><br>
<li>How do you know if information is valid, true, current and unbiased?</li><br>
<li>What tools or websites are available that will stimulate creative thinking? (eg. Flickr, Animoto)</li><br>
<li>What should I consider if I'm using online tools? (Issues such as copyright, lack of visual cues etc)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>If you have any questions or comments in advance of the workshop, please post them as "feedback" to this post.</p><br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Well, apart from the fact that most of what is on show at these exhibitions hasn't changed significantly in years (as compared to the cutting edge of what's happening in learning technology), I disagree that going to an exhibition is the "most cost-effective way to keep yourself up-to-speed".</p><br>
<p>A better way by far is to use a <strong>free</strong> RSS reader (like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>), and subscribe to a handful of blogs in your field of interest (also free).</p><br>
<p>The only cost then is your time - which, at a few minutes a day, is probably more easy to manage than taking a day or two our to visit the exhibition.</p><br>
<p>Suffice to say, I probably won't be there, unless someone asks me to help on their stand ;-)</p><br>

(And, no, I don't think all my posts are equal in quality. It's just that some of the ones I carefully crafted haven't seemed to have the readership I would have expected / hoped for.)<br>
<br>
I think Ewan's right when he says:<br>
<blockquote>Twitter has, for most folk, become their aggregator of choice. No longer do blog posts have a half-life of 24 hours, happily resting in your Google Reader until you launch it in the morning (your morning). Instead, your blog post has to hit a sweet spot where the maximum number of connectors and spreaders are awake, at their machine and ready to press "Retweet". That means hitting "Publish" at a time convenient to the mass of educators on the East Coast US, with a half-life of minutes before it is lost in the stream of other thoughts, resources and locker-room banter about baseball.<br>
<br>
The conversations have also disappeared from most of the blogs that I, at least, read from outside the US and Canada. They're maybe happening on Twitter, but are now dislocated from their origins, impossible to trace back, and even more impregnable to those coming in 24 hours late.</blockquote><br>
<br>
When you use Twitter, there's this constant nagging feeling that you're missing something important. And it's true. Unlike an RSS reader, which stores stuff until I'm ready to read it, Twitter posts will last a very short time.<br>
<br>
Where are we going with our conversations? Do we want fast food, and immediate gratification? Or are we going to take time to really think and really communicate?<br>

Most, if not all, come from the position that learning interventions are to be managed in a top-down manner; employees will learn when the management direct them to do so.<br>
<br>
Real work is not like that. Employees will need to learn outside of your carefully directed interventions. They might want to follow-up something with a colleague they met on a course. They might want to refer back to a particular page in some elearning content. They might want to look up some information, but they're not sure where to find it.<br>
<br>
Companies invest thousands, perhaps millions, in their learning management systems, yet there is a huge amount of untapped return in that investment. The following questions might help purchasers to get a system that can really make a difference, and they might even make the LMS providers get up-to-date with expectations.<br>
<br>
<h3>How does your system drive learners into it?</h3><br>
<br>
We want to make sure our systems are used to their maximum, to get maximum return on the investment. If all we do is send out reminder emails about new courses we are missing out on everything that's been learnt in web applications over the past ten years.<br>
<br>
Some examples of how systems can drive users to use them:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Intelligent, recommendation-based marketing - that links up prospective purchasers (in our case, learners) with products (ie. courses/content). Our systems should be building up user profiles that allow them to make suggestions based on prior history and what other people are doing</li><br>
  <li>User-based connections - if a learner likes something that they've done/seen on your LMS, why isn't there a button that let's them share it on Facebook, on Twitter, on LinkedIn, on whereever they connect with their colleagues?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>How does your system go to where the users are?</h3><br>
<br>
All too often, we build systems that rely on the user having to login at their PC to see updates, or to interact with it.<br>
<br>
The world has changed. These days, the systems that people interact with most are those that build multiple routes into them. Some examples:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Buttons in the browser toolbar, or browser extensions - If you have a page that you want people to update on a regular basis (eg. a learning record), then provide a button they can drag to their browser toolbar so it's there and visible when they need it. Even better, build a browser extension that provides that form without them having to visit the page.</li><br>
  <li>Mobile apps - Think about the activity a learner/manager might want to do when they are away from their desktop, (eg. find some information, approve attendance at a course) and build a mobile version of your system that exposes those key functions. It doesn't have to be a device-specific app, just a mobile version of the web site.</li><br>
  <li>Prompted interactions - Is it enough to just collect evaluation data straight after the course/event? Shouldn't we be collecting it from the learners (and their managers) after some time has elapsed? Simple prompts by email (just like Amazon prompts you to review a product) will increase take-up massively.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>How does your system support people who need performance support, not training?</h3><br>
<br>
We try to package up our learning interventions into neat parcels, like SCORM packages or courses. But learning doesn't happen in neat parcels. Mostly it happens when people need to learn. Usually that's not when their working through one of our interventions, and they don't often need the whole intervention, just part of it.<br>
<br>
So, you've put a great MS Excel training package in your LMS, but you find that people are still using Google to find web-based resources to help them do pivot-tables. Why is that? Because the LMS materials aren't searchable. Perhaps the learners didn't know they were there, or perhaps they couldn't face trawling through a long flash presentation to find the bit they really needed.<br>
<br>
If learners can't easily find what they need in your LMS, they will go elsewhere. For this reason, a good search engine, which indexes the <strong>content</strong> of your materials, (not just the metadata about them) is critical.<br>
<br>
<h3>How does your system allow learners to connect with other people in similar situations?</h3><br>
<br>
One of the major benefits of a face-to-face event is the way it allows people to interact with other people, from other parts of the organisation.<br>
<br>
Online learning, in contrast is a lonely, isolating business. Yet we have the technology to link people together who are undertaking the same or similar courses. Why don't our LMS's make more of that? Or are purchasers going for a divide and conquer approach? The rest of the world is designing systems that are all about helping people to connect, communicate and learn. Surely this is part of the remit of L&amp;D?</div><h1>Advertising on Learning Conversations</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I get the occasional request to put advertising on this blog.

I’ll be cycling 230 miles over 3 days, 90 miles of which will be in one day, and it's all on behalf of The Big Issue Foundation.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to ask people for donations (unless you want to that is). What I propose to do is the following:<br>

There's so much expertise available for free on the web.<br>
<br>
Every so often, a product comes along to make me rethink that position.<br>
<br>
Most of the advice and tutorials on the web about MS Excel are designed to walk you through the basics, or to answer specific questions. Much of it is very good - once you've found the right page for you. But most of it is purely showing and telling. Occasionally someone will create a simulation based on a screen-capture movie, where you can interact with different parts of the screen.<br>
<br>
Where <a href="http://www.exceleverest.com/">Excel Everest</a> differs is that it uses Excel itself as the platform for teaching about Excel. You're taken through a progression of structured exercises, gradually increasing in difficulty. Each exercise requires you to perform an operation in Excel, and you get immediate feedback.<br>
<br>
You can jump around within the system using the navigation buttons that the designers have provided. So, if you're just interested in practising pivot-tables, you can go straight to that part. These navigation buttons all seem pretty intuitive, and appear just when you need them.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty au fait with Excel, but I learnt some really useful things, just after spending a few minutes with Excel Everest:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>You can perform operations (multply, add etc) at the same time as you do a Paste-Special</li><br>
  <li>Ctrl-1 brings up the Format Cells dialogue box. That will be a real time-saver.</li><br>
  <li>F5-Special allows you to jump, not just to a specific cell, but a specific type of cell.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The writing style is quite friendly and informal (that's not a criticism - as it works), and sometime it feels like there's a lot of text to read on screen, particularly if you want to read all the instructions. That's partly because the lines are quite long and therefore difficult to scan.<br>
<br>
The pricing on the website is for non-commercial use. This includes an individual buying it for their own use inside their company. If you're looking to roll this out to train people across your organisation, Excel Everest ask you to get in touch to talk about their licensing structure. I'm told they already have clients such as <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.playcore.com/">PlayCore</a>, and <a href="http://www.hymans.co.uk/">Hymans Robertson</a>.<br>
<br>
So, would I recommend Excel Everest? Yes. If you know you're going to be using Excel as one of your main tools, then it really would be worth it.<br>

Due to the snow, I was unable to get to London, but by the magic of <a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a>, we were able to continue as planned. Working online did require quite a considerable rework of the workshop design. So we ended up with the following structure:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Introductions - around the phone conference</li><br>
  <li>Some activities to get used to the features of the Webex environment (eg. Chat), at the same time as finding out more about the people in the room and what they were hoping to get from the session.</li><br>
  <li>A structured conversation, that looked at what helps us to be creative. This led onto thinking about <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/about.html">Connectivism</a> and our personal creativity and learning networks - ie. the individuals and groups we go to for help in solving problems.</li><br>
  <li>A walk around my own knowledge management and problem solving tools.</li><br>
  <li>Three activities away from the conference: Read <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2009/03/sense-making-with-pkm/">Harold Jarche's post on Personal Knowledge Management</a>; watch the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bengardner135/meet-jessica">Meet Jessica Slideshare presentation</a> about knowledge sharing in Pfizer; identify tools that might help them create content, share content, collaborate on content, ask questions and make decisions. We used the <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html">C4LPT list</a> as a starting point, and collected the ideas in a shared Google document.</li><br>
  <li>A plenary session where we shared the tools identified, and discussed issues about using such tools inside a corporate environment.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Planning for an online workshop requires much more explicit "getting to know you" activity, and explicit space allowed for raising questions, making comments etc</li><br>
  <li>Don't try to be too ambitious when asking people to use unfamiliar tools - especially when they require accounts to be set up (ie. Google Docs)</li><br>
  <li>Webex is really very good - especially when it comes to pulling video and web content into both structured and unstructed presentations. The only thing I miss from other tools is the ability for delegates to offer instant reaction feedback - via polls and visual cues.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://qik.com/">Qik</a> - the mobile phone streaming video tool gets a very strong "Wow!" reaction. Even now, I can't quite believe that it's possible to point my cheap Nokia phone at the snow and get the video to appear instantly in a browser being displayed inside a Webex session!</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.doodle.com/">Doodle</a> is a fantastic tool to get people started thinking about storing data centrally to make it easier to get things done.</li><br>

On 27 March 2011 the next census in England and Wales takes place. There are over 29,000 Census Collector jobs to be created. These jobs are crucial to ensuring the 2011 Census is consistently accurate. Millions of pounds of government and local authority funding is dependent on the census information - so it's important to get it right.<br>
<br>
Census Collectors contact householders to collect completed census questionnaires and assist where required. There is the choice of hours - 15, 25 or 37 hours a week, depending on availability, and work will last from 6 to 8 weeks.<br>

I am the elearning manager for the 2011 Census operation. Even so, I would have added this post anyway!</div><h1>6 reasons not to maintain a school service during closure days</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Both my children's schools were closed for over three days last week due to snow. It was definitely right to close the buildings, but no explanation came from the schools as to why all teaching and learning activity also had to stop.<br>
<br>
Both schools have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_platform">learning platforms</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment">VLEs</a>). In my view, a school that has embedded usage of these tools in their day to day activity should not need to stop work when the buildings are closed.<br>
<br>
But here are 6 reasons for schools who don't want to use technology to maintain a service during closure days:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>It's too different to how we normally operate, so the students won't be able to handle it.<br>[My response: Why aren't you using these tools to support your normal work?]</li><br>
  <li>Our teachers are not confident in the use of these tools.<br>[My response: Why not?]</li><br>
  <li>Some of the students do not have internet access.<br>[My response: OK. So how are you going to plan ahead so that these students can have access - whether at friends or elsewhere?]</li><br>
  <li>Some of the teachers do not have internet access.<br>[My response: How can a teacher be effective these days without it? How are you going to plan ahead so they can get access when it's needed?]</li><br>
  <li>We don't have a Learning Platform.<br>[My response: You don't need one. Just start by using the masses of free tools listed on <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html">Jane Hart's C4LPT website</a>. Or sign-up for <a href="http://www.google.com/educators/p_apps.html">Google Apps for Educators</a> (also free). When you have worked out what you really need a Learning Platform to do, then you can start to think about buying one to meet your specific needs.]</li><br>
  <li>The students wouldn't do the work anyway.<br>[My response: What are your expectations of the students? What incentives do you already use as part of classroom management? What support do teachers get from Senior Management in handling unwilling learners? Why can't you extend those strategies to online work as well?]</li><br>
  <li>It's extra work for the teachers to produce all the resources required.<br>[My response: Yes, maybe. But there are real, practical benefits to teaching and learning online that will balance it out, such as: automated marking, deeper and broader learning, opportunity for less confident learners to contribute etc (See the <a href="http://www.eep-edu.org/InnService/Start/what_addval_start.htm">European Education Partnership for more</a>)]</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
What reasons did your school give for not maintaining a service last week? What are their strategies in the case of a long term closure (such as with a flu epidemic)? Are these really practical if they're not already putting those strategies in practice on a day-to-day basis?<br>

<br>
There are some good ideas in the comments - including that of using Plone, which I wouldn't have considered (but that's probably because I can't get my head around how it works!)<br>
<br>
My thoughts pasted below:<br>
<br>
For really good advice on intranets, I’d always point towards http://www.steptwo.com.au/ – their intranet review toolkit in particular is especially useful.<br>
<br>
Cloud-based tools like Yammer are great, but you do lose a level of control that many organisations feel they need.<br>
<br>
If you have an internet-based intranet then you really need to think about authentication and maintaining the user database. It’s not trivial.<br>
<br>
Intranets inside the network are far easier to manage and maintain (but, in my experience, considerably harder to implement). My gut feel is to start by looking at WordPress + BuddyPress for general publishing and networking (eg. Yammer-type stuff). Sharepoint is good for document management, but, to add anything additional to the out-of-the-box setup is something that can only be done by someone with the ability to run the command line on the server. (At least that’s my experience with Sharepoint 2003 – it may have changed since then).</div><h1>Marketing in the world of social media</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/book/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> is the place to go if you're serious about joining in the conversation about your products.<br>
<br>
But, here are some ideas to help get you started:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The marketplace is a two-way conversation. You're not talking <strong>to</strong> your market and telling them what you're good at, you're talking <strong>with</strong> your market about shared problems.</li><br>
  <li>Conversations on the web rely on authenticity and honesty. If you're going to talk "marketing-speak" then you will be found out and (at best) ignored very quickly.</li><br>
  <li>You cannot just tell people that you're good at whatever it is you sell, you need to demonstrate expertise. Basically you do that by giving away knowledge. It's what's expected. If I go to a website that's just full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware">brochureware</a>, I tend to lose confidence in that company.</li><br>
  <li>To demonstrate expertise you need to either get involved in open conversations about your specialist areas, or you need to give away easily digestible chunks of knowledge on a regular basis. Ideally you'll be doing both.</li><br>
  <li>The companies that do inspire confidence are the ones that are responsive (ie. picking up on issues quickly and keeping the market informed) and the ones that are honest (if something doesn't work yet, then say so!)</li><br>
  <li>Finally, and most importantly, make sure the product you're selling is worth talking about!</li><br>

Thanks to <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-case-you-missed-it-year-in-posts.html">Clive Shepherd</a> for the idea of looking back in this way.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all those people who have engaged in conversation whether face to face or online. It's that process of asking and answering questions that helps to refine my thinking.</div><h1>A first look at Moodle 2</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've been using <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle 2.0</a> in anger for a few months now, and thought it was time to put down a few thoughts about how it differs from Moodle 1.x.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I would say I'm only scratching the surface of Moodle 2's functionality. There's a lot of behind-the-scenes changes that I'm just not touching at all (eg. the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_2.0_release_notes#For_developers:_API_changes">new API's</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API = Application Programming Interface</a>)<br>
<br>
So, this is just an initial look at some of the things that have jumped out as I've used it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Conditional Activities</h3><br>
<br>
In Moodle 1.x it was possible to set up conditional activities only with quite a major hack to the code. In Moodle 2.0 it's built in, and works extremely well.<br>
<br>
This was why I chose to use Moodle 2.0 for a project I'm working on. It's allowed us to create an assignment, and then show a suggested answer to that assignment only once the tutor has given a mark.<br>
<br>
That's what Conditional Activities do - they allow course designers to set up quite sophisticated pathways that only open up once certain conditions have been met.<br>
<br>
How you use them will depend very much on your learning philosphy - particularly your belief as to how much control a learner should have over their own lesson. If you're one of <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/does-president-obama-support-locking-your-e-learning-course-navigation/">those people who won't even let a learner turn over the page until they completed an activity on that page</a> then you'll have a field day with this new functionality.<br>
<br>
If you're more like me, and prefer to provide a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolded learner experience</a> with free access to resources, then you'll want to use this with care.<br>
<br>
<h3>Management menus</h3><br>
<br>
Now, I don't know whether it's just because I've grown up with Moodle (since version 1.0!) but there are some bits of the new interface it's taking a little while to get used to.<br>
<br>
I quite liked the Update this Activity button at the top right. It was always there, and easy to get to.<br>
<br>
Similarly, when I'm supporting users I often used the Login As button on their profile. It was in a sensible place, at the bottom of their profile.<br>
<br>
Now the interface consists of an administration menu block that changes depending on where you are in the site.<br>
<br>
This has several advantages, but some key disadvantages:<br>
<br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>It allows more functionality to be exposed immediately to the user</li><br>
<li>It's in a consistent place, and behaves in a consistent way</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4><br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>If you've got more than a couple of blocks on the page, this administration block disappears off the bottom of the page very quickly. That means the user has to scroll immediately just to get to core functions.</li><br>
<li>The interface is now separated from the functions it's controlling. It's only a minor change, but has a significant impact</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Theme packs</h3><br>
<br>
There are some major changes to the ways theme packs are designed (See post: <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/11/03/creating-a-new-theme-for-moodle-2?blog=5">Creating a Moodle 2.0 theme</a>). It means that your Moodle 1.9 themes will need a complete rework.<br>
<br>
Having said that, it didn't take long to get the hang of how the new CSS structures work. The only thing I wasn't able to do is remove the "Show topic" buttons from the course page. This was always <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/11/27/working-with-moodle-themes?blog=5">the first thing I did in Moodle 1.x</a>, as, in my experience, that one part of the interface causes great problems for users.<br>
<br>
The new theming structure should mean we'll get a lot more good-looking Moodle sites. With Moodle 1.x you could see a Moodle site from miles away. I'm looking forward to coming across a site and not knowing it's Moodle...<br>
<br>
<h3>Course files interface</h3><br>
<br>
I know there's been a lot of discussion about this already, but this is one part of Moodle where I think the interface has lost out to functionality.<br>
<br>
When I first came across Moodle I was responsible for another online learning system that we were selling into schools. As part of my work, I spent three days with each school, helping them get to grips with the system and working through the implications of online learning on school structures and practices. At least, that was the theory. In practice, much of the time was spent walking the teachers through the convoluted process of getting files onto the server, and then building a link to those files.<br>
<br>
Moodle was a breath of fresh air. The workflow had obviously been designed by real people. You started out by saying you wanted to add a Resource to a course, and then Moodle took you through a carefully crafted process to add the resource and upload the file(s).<br>
<br>
For those who wanted to be a bit more advanced, it was possible to upload a zip file of resources, and then, after unzipping, use those files for other course resources.<br>
<br>
The only problem with the Moodle 1.x approach was that of reusability. Each course would need its own copy of the files it needed. Let's say there was a standard document that needed to go into each course, it would need a separate copy in each course file store.<br>
<br>
This led to a few difficulties. If that document needed to change, then it would have to be reuploaded many times. No problem if you've got a small Moodle site. But for large sites, or sites with large files, it became quite a headache.<br>
<br>
For many the answer was to leave Moodle's basic, but friendly, content-management functions, and implement repositories (like <a href="http://www.giuntilabs.com/en/products/harvestroad-hive-digital-repository">HarvestRoad Hive</a>) that sat underneath Moodle. These are great systems, but often quite complex and expensive.<br>
<br>
Moodle 2.0 has adopted a different approach to managing content.<br>
<br>
For the details of it, take a look at Moodle Docs. Basically, it allows files to be used more than once; across multiple courses. But, in doing so, the workflow for basic use has become considerably more complex. Course designers/teachers now have to make many more choices when working through the process - with a corresponding increase in the confusion that can result.<br>
<br>
The underlying model is far less easy to comprehend and explain than the old course files store. Which, for people without an IT background, can be quite a barrier to use.<br>
<br>
Also, there now appears to be no way of uploading a batch of files in one zip file, and then picking from those files for a number of resources. (Please tell me if that's not true!)<br>
<br>
I haven't got an answer to the zip file problem, but my solution to the complex interface would be to, by default, only give users a basic "upload files" interface, with the option to switch on "advanced file management" as they gain in confidence.<br>
<br>

This was always one of the first additional modules I put into my Moodle 1.x sites. It provided a way of creating a set of HTML pages very quickly. No, it wasn't particularly pretty, and didn't do anything fancy (like annotations or comments) from a learning perspective. But it was useful.<br>
<br>
I'd hoped this would be incorporated into a new multi-page HTML resource-type in Moodle 2.0, but that hasn't yet appeared, and there's no news yet on when the Book module will be ported across to Moodle 2.x.<br>
<br>
I know this is a major blocker for many organisations who would otherwise upgrade their Moodle sites. Let's hope it gets sorted soon.<br>
<br>
<h3>Conclusions</h3><br>
<br>
Moodle 2.0 has been a long time coming. There's a lot that has changed under the bonnet (hood), but these are invisible to most people. Those who were hoping for more of a web 2.0 design and user interface will be quite disappointed. There's a lot of work to be done to make the (admin) interface compare with tools like <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> and <a href="http://www.kashflow.co.uk/default_b.asp">Kashflow</a>. For people who have now grown up with Amazon, Google and Ebay, these factors are critical to encourage organisation-wide adoption.<br>
<br>
If we're not careful, Moodle will become loved by the techies and senior management, but will lose its core fanbase - the teachers and course designers who fell for Moodle's simplicity and ease of use. It's a fine balance to keep; help those who pay the bills, whilst, at the same time, help those who will champion the system in their organisations.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that Moodle 2.0 will be the start of some major improvements to bring Moodle into this decade. It's still an extremely flexible platform for tutor-led learning interventions, and certainly one I'd still recommend any organisation consider to support teaching or training.</div><h1>System rollouts and effective networked communication</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Last week, <a href="http://charles-jennings.blogspot.com/">Charles Jennings</a> wrote an important analysis of the <a href="http://charles-jennings.blogspot.com/2010/12/who-needs-training-again.html">state of training and the need for more "performance support" initiatives</a>.<br>
<br>
It raised a fair bit of discussion.<br>
<br>
Focussing on new system rollouts for the time-being, here's my take on what's required for a successful rollout.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/rollout_plan.png"><img alt="Rollout and communications plan" src="./assets/rollout_plan.png" width="434" height="650"></a><p>Rollout and communications plan</p></div><br>
<br>
Most system rollouts only look at communicating with users once the rollout is ready to begin. This is too late. As the diagram shows, I propose that it's far better to start that communication process as early as possible. But don't despair - even if you're already half way through, you can still use the tools and techniques I suggest. Just start further down the diagram.<br>
<br>
This communication should be two way. Effective system rollouts need to listen to users, not just tell them what will be happening.<br>
<br>
Making this communication happen isn't difficult. The tools to do it are freely available, and very simple to set up. The easiest, and probably most effective, tool to use is a networked micro-blogging system such as <a href="https://www.socialcast.com/">Socialcast</a>, <a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> or <a href="http://theflowr.com/">Flowr</a> or even a simple, and <strong>license</strong>-free (NB. NOT free!) <a href="http://buddypress.org/">WordPress/BuddyPress</a> site.<br>
<br>
<h3>Wanted: Community engagement lead</h3><br>
<br>
You'll need to have someone on board who's responsible for community engagement. Let's say that's you... Ideally you'll already have quite a good network within the organisation. If not, you'll need to build one pretty quickly, mainly by being useful!<br>
<br>
Start by asking questions (on the blog) about the war stories you're hearing. Talk about the stories you're hearing offline too... Try to get to the heart of the real problem. <br>
<br>
When you feel you've understood the problem, write it down in words that your users will understand. Post it on the project blog. Encourage comments.<br>
<br>
All this should help your business analyst to specify what's required from the system.<br>
<br>
Your job is then to explain what has been specified. Set expectations. Don't over-promise.<br>
<br>
<h3>Keep listening</h3><br>
<br>
You'll (hopefully) get more comments back. Whatever you do, don't ignore them. When you stop showing that you're listening, that's when your potential champion users will disengage from the process.<br>
<br>
Once the system is built, it will be your job to show it in action. Use a tool like <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing/">Jing</a> to create quick demonstrations of the system solving some of the problems your users raised at the beginning. If that's not appropriate, build some quick annotated Powerpoints (or similar).<br>
<br>
Bring in some of your most vociferous commenters to do the User Acceptance Testing. Again, it's these people who will become your champions. Watch them use the system. By doing so you will quickly pick up the pinch points - the places where users will stumble and not be sure what to do. (With one system I looked at today that was on the first page!!!)<br>
<br>
If the testing is successful, consider videoing the champions talking about their experiences, and how they think the system will help. You do have a way of distributing video in your organisation, don't you?<br>
<br>
If the testing is not successful, explain why. (Although, by this time, your network of champions will probably be doing so already...) Again, keep it real. Set expectations that you believe can be achieved.<br>
<br>
Use the results of the testing to build Frequently Asked Questions. Don't forget, these won't just be technical (how-do-I) questions. A lot of them will be why-do-I - without that understanding many people won't get very far.<br>
<br>
Use your blog to provide examples of good practice (eg. <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/">Rapid elearning blog</a>), preferably with pictures, videos or screen-capture movies. Highlight what your champions are doing. Give them recognition and they'll help you by becoming advocates and trainers.<br>
<br>
As people use the system, and raise support calls, you should maintain the FAQs, and monitor and respond to comments raising further questions.<br>
<br>
Ideally your systems will have automated status monitoring that users can check out if they're having problems. If not, then make sure that someone is responsible for immediately publicing issues as soon as they occur (eg. <a href="http://status.hostdime.com/">Hostdime</a> - an exemplary company for support and customer communication). For one thing it will reduce support calls, but it will also improve the reputation of the system team, as users will know they're being kept informed.<br>
<br>
Finally, I've said you need to provide great customer support. I've dealt with that in a previous post, but all the work you've done up to now will provide an incredibly useful foundational knowledge-base.<br>
<br>
<h3>Networked communication is key</h3><br>
<br>
At the heart of this whole user support / training / communication initiative is a very simple networked communication system. Yes, you'll still need some traditional communications for those people who choose to keep separate from the network. But, by making use of the connections that already exist between people you'll find your system rollout a whole lot easier. Take a look at the short presentation below to see why.<br>
<br>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_4451972"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/berthelemy/getting-message-across" title="Getting the message across">Getting the message across</a></strong><object id="__sse4451972" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gettingmessageacross-100609090553-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=getting-message-across&amp;userName=berthelemy"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed name="__sse4451972" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gettingmessageacross-100609090553-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=getting-message-across&amp;userName=berthelemy" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></object><div style="padding:5px 0 12px">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/berthelemy">Mark Berthelemy</a>.</div></div><br>
<br>
Such a communication tool need not just be for system rollouts. In fact, I'd recommend that every organisation of more than 12 people considers implementing one. The larger the organisation the more useful it can become - for performance support, knowledge sharing, and for identifying issues before they become problems.</div><h1>A model for continuing professional development</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Over the past few years, I have gained enormously by listening to, and engaging with a<br>
number of communities of practice; within teaching, higher education and workplace training.<br>
<br>
Existing on the boundaries of these communities has allowed me to bring ideas from different<br>
sectors into whichever job I find myself doing.<br>
<br>
Whilst at the <a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/32996820/Collabor8-4-Change-at-BETT-2011">Collaborate for Change</a> event last week (also, see <a href="http://www.zoeross.com/2011/01/14/c84c-more-please/">Zoe Ross's review</a>), I spent a fair bit of time talking with<br>
people about teacher professional development. But, actually, the ideas being generated<br>
apply equally to almost any other profession or community of practice.<br>
<br>
<h3>Motivation – the key</h3><br>
<br>
The key underlying factor for any successful professional development model is motivation.<br>
I spent a long time, whilst working as a teacher, expecting my school or local authority to<br>
provide whatever professional development it thought I needed. It was only when I moved<br>
to the corporate world, into an environment where responsibility for your actions (and your<br>
mistakes) was devolved as far down as possible, that I discovered the need (and the benefits)<br>
of taking responsibility for my own learning.<br>
<br>
That's a long process though, and depends very much on an enabling culture of both management<br>
and financial decision-making. Either that, or it depends on mavericks; people who take<br>
responsibility for themselves, simply because they know it's the best way to improve what<br>
they do.<br>
<br>
Alongside that bottom-up driven professional development, there need to be some external<br>
motivating factors that will help reluctant learners to take responsibility for their own<br>
development. These might include:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Recognition</li><br>
<li>Increased pay</li><br>
<li>Better chances of promotion</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>A deepening framework</h3><br>
<br>
I have had the chance to observe, and take part in, a number of professional development<br>
opportunities. Some have been incredibly useful, others less so.<br>
<br>
The list below comes from these experiences. As you move down the list, the depth of<br>
learning possible becomes greater. Basically, the more you put into an experience, the more you will get out of it.<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Watching a presentation, listening to a talk or lecture</li><br>
<li>Taking an active part in a conversation where you have to argue a point, both online<br>
or offline. There are a number of models for this, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_%28conversation%29">Fishbowl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_circle">Study Circles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning">Action<br>
Learning Sets</a>, and table top conversations (like we did at Collaborate for Change)</li><br>
<li>Producing and sharing resources to support other professionals</li><br>
<li>Reflecting on input that you have experienced</li><br>
<li>Reflecting on that input in public, and responding to feedback</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
This is an extreme simplification of some much better thought out models, such as <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">Gilly<br>
Salmon's 5 stage model</a> (which was designed for online learning, but applies equally well to<br>
any context where the aim is to encourage deep professional development).</div><h1>A Chartered Institute for Teaching?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>In the last week, I've spent a fair bit of time talking with colleagues from the education sector.</p><br>
<p>One of the topics of discussion was teacher professional development, and how we might encourage teachers to take more responsibility for their own learning.</p><br>
<p>I would contend that any profession worth that name will have continuing professional development at its core. It will be a requirement for remaining a member of that profession.</p><br>
<p>Not so with teaching (at least in England). The <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/">General Teaching Council for England</a>, although being the government-sponsored professional body, has not dared to challenge the unions by imposing professional development requirements on membership. (NB. I'm not anti-union. I was in the <a href="http://www.teachers.org.uk/">NUT</a> whilst teaching. But sometimes they have too much power to block things that shouldn't be blocked.)</p><br>
<p>The political will is obviously not there to address this challenge centrally. So, I would propose that, just like the <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/">CIPD</a> (for HR specialists) and <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/">ALT</a> (for Learning Technologists), there should be a Chartered Institute for Teaching (CIT).</p><br>
<p>Membership would be voluntary, but, over time, such membership would become the badge of choice for a teacher who was committed to their own professional development. The long term goal would be for membership to become a recognised requirement for a teaching post.</p><br>
<p>Unlike CIPD, I don't see this organisation providing courses or qualifications. Instead it would provide a service whereby teachers could maintain a record of their professional development – choosing to publish some of it as a public portfolio.</p><br>
<p>By CPD, I don't just mean courses. There's a massive range of CPD opportunities available to teachers, if they would just engage with them.</p><br>
<p>Professions, such as law, accountancy, medicine etc, all allow their members to maintain records of the CPD hours they have undertaken. I would propose a subtly different model. Instead of measuring the time taken, a better measure would be the amount of thought and effort put in.</p><br>
<p>The table below is a starting point for such a framework. It will need refinement, I'm sure.</p><br>
<p>Let's say that to maintain membership in the CIT, teachers need to have achieved 200 CPD points in any 12 month period (measured on a rolling basis).  Points can be gained in the following ways:</p><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

<p>The more points you gain over 200, the greater the level of membership. So 200 points gives you member status, whilst 300 would give Advanced status etc.</p><br>
<p>The rationale I'm working on is that sharing knowledge should be rewarded, and the more thought that has gone into that, the greater the reward.</p><br>
<p>As I say, the model needs to be refined, and gaps filled in.  I'd welcome any feedback ...</p><br>
<p>a) Do you think a Chartered Institute of Teaching has a future?</p><br>
<p>b) Do you agree with the membership model</p><br>
<p>c) Do you agree with the points model?</p><br>
<p>d) Which of these funding sources would be most viable: freemium (some free services, with benefits for paid-up members), commercial sponsorship, government (as if!) - to be honest I'd like to avoid government funding with all the constraints that puts on things.</p><br>
<p>e) I envisage this as a non-profit making organisation - with transparency in all aspects at its heart. Would that work for you?</p></div><h1>Return on investment and training</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>I posted this on Twitter recently to see what response I got:</p><br>

<br>
This is a project that has ideals very close to my heart. They have seen the need, and are looking to develop a sustainable and scalable model that uses appropriate technologies to provide access to quality educational materials and mentors.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>... around the world, many educational systems are underperforming. Globally, more than 300 million children will fail to complete five grades of primary education, and will leave without basic literacy skills. For millions who remain in school, the quality of education is dismal, and little effective learning takes place.<br>
<br>
The net result of this educational crisis has been that the target of halving the incidence of adult illiteracy has been missed, and the Education for All decade has seen a rise in the number of illiterate adults. The price paid by societies that fail to improve their educational systems, and the cumulative effect of poor educational performance, has been long understood (eg. Marshall, Alfred (1961), Principles of Economics)<br>
<br>
This suggests that it is not only efforts to improve education, but the approach used to achieve these improvements that must change.<br>
<br>
Educational quality can be improved through 21st century learning technologies. New social learning techniques are proven to accelerate the time to competency of learners, increase the engagement of younger learners and provide a scalable model to improve opportunities for education and training. By making the best learning tools and lessons available in an engaging and accessible format, we can improve access to high quality education around the world.<br>
<br>
From basic literacy to advanced chemistry, the Virtual School aims to revolutionise learning. It will improve the accessibility and quality of locally generated, student centric educational content; available for anyone, anywhere, regardless of their geographic or socio-economic circumstances.<br>
<br>
From the Virtual School proposal</blockquote><br>
<br>
This is a serious project with serious people contributing to it, from across the telecommunications and IT industry, and experts in ICT, adult learning and education. The group that met on Thursday included a number from senior corporate and government positions in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.<br>
<br>
The video below explains the background of the project, its aims and the methods that are being explored.<br>
<br>
It's exciting, and it's potentially going to make a massive difference. That's why I'm involved. How about you?<br>

<br>
The most fascinating presentation (of the ones I watched) was that from Mohit Midha, who heads up Blue Duck Education, which produces <a href="http://www.mangahigh.com/">Mangahigh.com</a><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/mangahigh.png"><img alt="Mangahigh.com" src="./assets/mangahigh.png" width="400" height="300"></a></div><br>
<br>
MangaHigh is "one of the world’s first games-based-learning sites, where students learn Mathematics via purpose-built casual games that balance fun and learning."<br>
<br>
Let me expand on that, and we'll see how (or if) their ideas can be translated into adult learning.<br>
<br>
First, I'll try to give you a flavour of what MangaHigh does for the student and for the teacher.<br>
<br>
The games within MangaHigh have a number of key characteristics:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>They are simple, usually based around a single task or activity.</li><br>
  <li>The are first and foremost MATHS. They are chock full of maths content.</li><br>
  <li>They are adaptive. If you do well, they get harder, and vice versa.</li><br>
  <li>They contain context-sensitive help which provides the knowledge required at the point of need. (Just like <a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2008/05/be-an-elearning-action-hero/">Cathy Moore's Action Mapping</a> model)</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So the games themselves are educationally highly effective. But it's the system around the games (the platform) that really adds the value.<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>It allows students from the same school to compete against each other to get to the top of the leader board.</li><br>
  <li>It allows schools in the same region to compete against each other</li><br>
  <li>Teachers set individual targets (Bronze, Silver or Gold medals) for specific groups of children within a particular game that covers the current topic (ie. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction">differentiation</a>)</li><br>
  <li>Teachers can monitor students' progress using a graph that shows the number of attempts against achievement.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, what have they found?<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Kids love it. They frequently spend far more time on the allocated game than they have to. So students who have been set a Bronze target are achieving Silver, or even Gold.</li><br>
  <li>Teachers love it. Instead of spending hours marking exercises, teachers are able to focus on helping individual students where they are struggling, or challenging students who need an extra push.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Leaving aside the benefits to the education sector, how can these ideas impact on adult learning?<br>
<br>
I would argue that, in an ideal world, simulations and games which are adaptive, competitive and supportive are a fabulous learning environment. You can see them in high-risk training situations like piloting an aeroplane.<br>
<br>
It's not necessarily the investment to create the games that is the issue (although it does increase exponentially the more variables you have to consider). The thing that is the blocker for me is learner time.<br>
<br>
In a normal working situation, most managers will want their employees to have enough of the right knowledge, skills and behaviours to get started and then the rest is learnt on the job. Most people just wouldn't be able to justify the amount of time that a child will spend on a game to become an expert.<br>
<br>
So, when learning is an essential pre-requisite to a job, games and simulations provide a valuable approach. When learning is just part of the job (as it is for most of us) then games and simulations will rarely be the right answer - unless they can be time-limited (eg. simulating a phone conversation for customer service training)<br>
<br>
However, what we <strong>can</strong> learn from games is the way they support their players through guidance at the point of need. It might be guidance on how to just get through that particular problem, or guidance on how to approach a problem in a different way, or use a tool more efficiently.<br>
<br>
The thing that we must remember, as workplace learning professionals, is that learning is rarely the reason people are doing the jobs. And it's almost certainly never the reason that the job exists in the first place. Learning interventions should always be subservient to performance, yet, at the same time learning should be a natural result of improved performance.</div><h1>Getting more from your LMS</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>A lot of people, including me(!), disparage the LMS (Learning Management System) quite vociferously.<br>
<br>
To be honest, the problem we have is often not the fault of the system, it's how it's used in conjunction with other systems.<br>
<br>
LMS's are brilliant (well, sometimes...) at handling administrative tasks like booking resources, sending out joining instructions, and dealing with approvals and the money side of things.<br>
<br>
They're also really good at automating measurement of achievement, eg. with a multiple-choice assessment or through a simulation.<br>
<br>
What they're not so good at is being a place where you store knowledge objects - documents, HTML pages, videos etc - ie. stuff that learners will read, listen to or watch.<br>
<br>
But that's how most LMS's are used... to store SCORM packages which are full of knowledge objects.<br>
<br>
The trouble with using an LMS for that purpose is that learners generally have to:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>login</li><br>
  <li>find the course or programme they want</li><br>
  <li>perhaps enrol on that course</li><br>
  <li>and then work through the SCORM package to find the specific piece of knowledge they need</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
That's fine for a formal learning situation, with someone who's a novice. You'll want them to get an overview of the issues and ideas.<br>
<br>
But, after that, learners will (hopefully) want to return to the materials, to refresh their knowledge, or to answer a question. It's learning at the point of need.<br>
<br>
That's where our typical SCORM packages inside LMS's fall down.<br>
<br>
Most people, when they want to find something out, do one of two things:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Ask someone who they think will know the answer.</li><br>
  <li>Look for the answer, eg. in a manual, or, more often these days, via a search engine.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
That's the problem. The LMS hides knowledge away from search engines (which can't dig into the SCORM packages). Even so, many organisations still don't have a decent search engine inside their firewalls.<br>
<br>
Even if a learner knew which SCORM package was the right one to look at, many don't include any sort of search facility. This means that learners have to trawl through all the information until they find the bit they need.<br>
<br>
So, what's the answer?<br>
<br>
I would argue that there is one thing that would make a huge difference:<br>

Make sure that all your knowledge objects are in an easily accessible and searchable content management system. These days it's not difficult or even expensive. But make sure the search engine doesn't just look at the metadata. It should search <strong>inside</strong> the documents/pages themselves (unless we're talking video or audio of course).<br>
<br>
Then use your LMS for what it's good for, and link to the knowledge objects whenever they're needed in your simulations, exercises or assessments.<br>
<br>
Ideally, the modern LMS would also contain a decent, user-searchable content management system. But as far as I'm aware, that's not true in most cases. Unless someone knows otherwise?<br>

As an educational professional, school governor, policy maker, parent, carer, learner in England the National Curriculum review affects you and the children under your care.<br>
<br>
If you are an employer in England it also affects you.<br>
<br>
In fact it's difficult to think of anybody that the outcome of this review does not touch in some way.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://ncr11.wikispaces.com/Get+Involved">Join the debate</a><br>
</div><br>
The <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/">UK Department for Education</a> <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/pressnotices/a0073149/national-curriculum-review-launched">recently announced a wholesale review of the curriculum for schools in England</a>.<br>
<br>
According to the announcement the review will:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>replace the current <em>substandard</em> curriculum with one based on the best school systems in the world, providing a world-class resource for teachers and children</li><br>
<li>consider what <em>subjects</em> should be compulsory at what age</li><br>
<li>consider <em>what children should be taught</em> in the main subjects at what age.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
(My emphases)<br>
<br>
I started teaching in 1989, just as the National Curriculum was launched into schools. The legislation underpinning it set the National Curriculum as establishing "an <strong>entitlement</strong> – all children should have access to learning in key areas". (<a href="http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/ca/digitalAssets/188853_Could_do_better_FINAL_inc_foreword.pdf">Oates, T. 2010 "Could do better", Cambridge Assessment</a>)<br>
<br>
At the time, particularly in Science (my subject), the curriculum presented was vast, and the requirements to track every child on every Attainment Target was unworkable (although we filled many filing cabinets trying to do so).<br>
<br>
Eventually there were revisions (after Ron Dearing's report in 1995, and then in the mid-2000's with input from the <a href="http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/index.aspx">QCA</a>) which slimmed things down a lot, and made the structure a lot less rigid than it had been perceived up till then.<br>
<br>
<h3>Structure and delivery</h3><br>
<br>
Following the QCA's revisions, and additional explanatory statements (removed from their website in January 2011), which explicitly emphasised "the importance of removing subject boundaries", organisations, such as the RSA (with their <a href="http://www.rsaopeningminds.org.uk/">Opening Minds curriculum</a>) reworked things based more around competencies than knowledge - changing the way that the National Curriculum is delivered. Already, over 200 schools in the UK are using their model.<br>
<br>
In Tim Oate's 2010 paper discussing an evidence-based method of reviewing the National Curriculum (<a href="http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/ca/Viewpoints/Viewpoint?id=135502">Could do better: Using international comparisons to refine the National Curriculum in England</a>, he concludes that, by this statement from the QCA, the National Curriculum began to step into new areas. He says that "the statements began strongly to emphasise very specific approaches to teaching – a degree of specification at odds with both the letter and spirit of legislation".<br>
<br>
In a way, that's actually quite good news, because he's being explicit that the National Curriculum should say nothing about how schools structure and "deliver" learning experiences for their students. That's great, as long as the forthcoming review report doesn't go on to suggest that schools would be better teaching things in separate subjects...<br>
<br>
<h3>Curriculum content</h3><br>
<br>
In Tim Oate's view, "a national curriculum should include that which is essential for participation in a modern, democratic society – the fundamentals necessary for progression." He goes on to say:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
Transnational comparisons make clear that high-performing systems ... focus on concepts and principles. ‘Concepts and principles’ include ‘conservation of mass’, ‘elasticity’, ‘metaphor’; within ‘concepts’ we can include understanding of ‘key operations’ such as ‘working with vectors’ in mathematics.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
On the role of subject knowledge, there seems to be a rather rapid divergence between the people Tim Oates was talking to (<a href="http://www.princes-ti.org.uk/WWIS/200910/">including a report from the Prince's Teaching Institute Headteacher's conference 2010</a>), and those educational mavericks (as they might be seen by the first group) who are looking at how the world outside school is now dealing with knowledge.<br>
<br>
In Tim Oate's view: "Pupils should emerge from schooling with large bodies of knowledge". Whereas many modern educationalists, academics and business people are now of the opinion that we should be focussing more on the skills that enable us to make better use of the knowledge and information that now fills our lives. (eg. the theory of <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/about.html">Connectivism</a> which seems to have a lot of acceptance among technologically confident people.)<br>
<br>
<h3>Some ideas to think about</h3><br>
<br>
In my view, there needs to be a balance struck between the two camps, although I'm firmly of the belief that facts are useless without context.<br>
<br>
In order to prepare our children for a life of work and leisure (that will probably be very different to that which we now experience), I think the National Curriculum should entitle every child to the following...<br>
<br>
By the time a child leaves formal, state-sponsored education, they should have experienced, <strong>at a minimum</strong>:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Reading, writing, engaging with and discussing, a wide range of writing - both fiction and non-fiction, from across history, genre, physical location and publishing medium (and here you would give a set of non-exclusive examples, but allow teachers to choose).</li><br>
<li>Enough mathematics to be allow you to make sensible purchases, carry out practical tasks in the home, understand news reports about economics and business, and critically intrepret statistics.</li><br>
<li>Enough science to be able to recognise bad science and to critically question journalism, corporate statements and marketing materials.</li><br>
<li>Enough knowledge about current geo-political affairs to be able to understand how history, geography, religion, politics and economics have created current world situations. And more importantly - how to dig deep into current situations to find out out what has led to them.</li><br>
<li>Opportunities to develop a practical skill, such as playing an instrument or learning a craft to a recognised standard.</li><br>
<li>Opportunities to spend a significant period of time immersed in a second language and culture. (This could, for example, mean learning Polish, Urdu or Punjabi)</li><br>
<li>Exploring the languages of creativity and culture, through film, poetry, music, theatre, video, animation etc - the precise area of study depending on the expertise available to the school.</li><br>
<li>Working collaboratively with students from another culture.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
You'll see I've used rough subject headings - but these are simply to help structure the curriculum entitlement - not to put a strait-jacket around how the curriculum should be delivered.<br>
<br>
The problem with a National Curriculum is that it will require some form of measurement and standardisation. Yet, when local and individual needs and resources are taken into account, such standardisation is not possible, and is, in my opinion, not desirable.<br>
<br>
Somehow (and this is where I need to think some more), we need to come up with a way of making what's important measurable instead than making things that are measurable important. That will have to be the subject of another post...<br>
<br>
I'll finish with a final quote from Tim Oates:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
While the problems are serious and require a policy response, revision of the National Curriculum should not be driven by partial consideration of the problems, and should be based on sophisticated understanding of the functions which a National Curriculum can support.<br>
<br>
Greater problems will most likely be created by expecting too much of a National Curriculum, or revising it in the wrong way.<br>
</blockquote></div><h1>Why learn HTML and CSS?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 31 January 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Over the weekend, a couple of people in my Personal Learning Network have mentioned that they would like to learn how to use HTML and CSS.<br>
<br>
Users of today's web-applications like Wordpress, Moodle, Google Docs etc will often never see any of the code that sits underneath what they write. These applications provide editing toolbars, not unlike any word-processor.<br>
<br>
So why should people involved in online learning need to learn about HTML and CSS?<br>
<br>
Here's a list of reasons, and then some places you could go for help:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>As <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/">Clive Shepherd</a> says in his most excellent book "<a href="https://www.lulu.com/commerce/index.php?fBuyContent=10025410">The New Learning Architect</a>":<br>
<blockquote>There can be no such thing as a technophobic learning architect, any more than there is an architect of buildings who hasn't come to terms with the basics of plumbing and electrics."</blockquote></li><br>
  <li>You'll have a far better idea of what you're seeing whenever a site like Slideshare or Youtube provides you with code to embed into your site.</li><br>
  <li>You'll understand your developers better.</li><br>
  <li>When you need to make changes to your site template you'll know what to look for and what to change.</li><br>
  <li>You'll understand the things that make a web page inaccessible to blind or partially-sighted users.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Where to go for help?</h3><br>
<br>
Top of the list has to be <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, by far the best free tutorial and reference resource on the web.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://oreilly.com/store/series/pocketrefs.html">O'Reilly Pocket Reference guides</a> also got a very positive mention during the conversation.<br>
<br>
There are a whole host of other books available. Check out the reviews on Amazon, but also go and look at them in your library (if you still have one!) or your bookshop. They're all covering the same stuff, but often have very different styles of presentation.<br>
<br>
Once you've got past the basics, most of what you'll need is available on the web, for free, in discussion forums and blogs. You just need to know what to search for...<br>
<br>
<h3>How to get started</h3><br>
<br>
However, probably the best way for a novice to start is to find someone who knows your particular field (eg. training/learning) well, can spend some time working through the basics, and then coach you through those initial stages of using the language. (Yes, it really is just like learning French or English, but a lot more logical!)<br>
<br>
If anyone's interested, I'd be happy to run something like that. We'd need to get a small group (4-5) together, so there could be some element of peer-learning too. Let me know if you'd be interested, and I'm sure we can work something out. But, please be aware that this would be done as part of my day job, so there'd be a cost involved...</div><h1>What is the purpose of education?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div class="image_block"><a href="http://purposed.org.uk/"><img class="alignright" alt="Purpos/ed logo" src="./assets/purposed_voice.jpg" width="200" height="110"></a></div><br>
Part of the <a href="http://purposed.org.uk/">purpos/ed project</a>.<br>
<br>
In a recent Twitter post, I said that I think that "the purpose of education is to develop a creative society that will ask difficult questions."<br>
<br>
I've made no mention of children, but, in all the posts in <a href="http://purposed.org.uk/archive/">this distributed conversation</a>, everyone seems to assume that education is something that society does with (or to) the youngest members of that society, until such a point at which they can learn on their own.<br>
<br>
Actually, from my point of view, we seem to do the opposite. We take children, who are literally "born learners", and we educate the ability to learn out of them, by forcing them through the sausage-machine that is our "education system".<br>
<br>
As <a href="http://loumcgill.co.uk/?p=466">Lou McGill so eloquently states</a>, from her experience, the state education system "offers a standardised one-dimensional approach that assumes a commonality of potential."<br>
<br>
How can we expect people to be creative, if we expect them all to achieve certain, set, targets, and disparage certain areas of learning as less important than others?<br>
<br>
The trouble is, our whole society, politically, economically, socially and educationally, is driven by competition rather than cooperation, on being seen to be better than others, rather than just being. We're all in it. There's almost no escape. It's part of our psyche. Our lives are built on becoming "better than" others.<br>
<br>
[youtube]w0DUsGSMwZY[/youtube]<br>
<br>
It takes quite a major rethink about the purpose of life itself to break free of that mindset...<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
... I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. <strong>I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation</strong>, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.<br>
<br>
(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 4:10</a> - sorry to my non-religious friends, but it's relevant)<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Let's say we do break free of discontentment. What then? What would be the purpose of education if we didn't have to keep proving ourselves?<br>
<br>
It would be about achieving our individual potential. It would be about helping each other to find out what we are good at, and developing those skills/gifts/talents. Not to be better than someone else, but to be as good as we can get.<br>
<br>
It would be about encouraging the creative minds we're born with, and developing them - not stifling them.<br>
<br>
It would be about looking out for injustice and not accepting it.<br>
<br>
It would be about being able to tell people how we feel, and about dealing with ourselves when we get hurt.<br>
<br>
It would be about learning about how the behaviour of this amazingly complex universe can be described by the most simple maths (eg. E = mc<sup>2</sup> - why???!).<br>
<br>
It would be about imagining yourself in someone else's shoes, having compassion, and knowing what to do about it.<br>
<br>
Stephen Downes says it so much better than me in his post: "<a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/08/things-you-really-need-to-learn.html">Things you really need to learn</a>"<br>
<br>
So, to summarise, the purpose of education in our current society is to become better than other people. If you're not satisfied with that (and I'm not), then you need to rethink what life is about, and then the purpose of education is to achieve your own, individual potential alongside other people.</div><h1>A 21st Century LMS conceptual model</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 4 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Early stages yet, but I'm working on a conceptual model for the 21st Century LMS.<br>

<br>
I'm reading <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/">Clive Shepherd's</a> recently published book "<a href="http://onlignment.com/thenewlearningarchitect/">The New Learning Architect</a>" at the moment.<br>
<br>
I got a free copy, on condition that I write a review of the book. But this is a book that I would actually go and buy.<br>
<br>
If you work in any aspect of learning &amp; development or training, this really is a "must read".<br>
<br>
It looks at the role of the learning architect (someone who works with the client to provide a solution, not someone who takes orders from a client), briefly covers some theories around learning and neuroscience, and then goes on with a whole set of example learning opportunities, covering:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Formal learning</li><br>
  <li>Non-formal learning</li><br>
  <li>On-demand learning</li><br>
  <li>Experiential learning</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Interspersed with these are profiles of 10 people he classes as learning architects, looking at what they've done in their organisations and what they've learnt in the process. Some of the names you'll know, others will be new I'm sure.<br>
<br>
The book is doing three things for me:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Putting a framework around the job title (Learning Solutions Architect) that I've had for over 5 years</li><br>
  <li>Providing models and examples that I can use with clients who continue to ask for products rather than solutions.</li><br>
  <li>Making me dig far more deeply into the neuroscience research surrounding our field than I ever thought I would!</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>Some highlights from the first couple of chapters</h3><br>
<br>
"... it is neither sufficient nor excusable for the learning architect to act as order taker." p.8<br>
<br>
"There can be no such thing as a technophobic learning architect, any more than there is an architect of buildings who hasn't come to terms with the basics of plumbing and electrics." p.13<br>
<br>
"When the knowledge that employees need to do their jobs changes so rapidly, it becomes pointless to try and teach it all." p.17<br>
<br>
"Resources play a far greater role in the overall learning landscape than do courses." Nick Shackleton-Jones profile p.30<br>
<br>
There will be more highlights as I digest this really rather excellent book.<br>

  <li>How it's possible, instead of going through a "painful" Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process, to use the terms people are searching for to understand what are their training needs.</li><br>
  <li>The exciting G-Whiz tool, which allows other people to tag you with what they think you're good at. (NB. There are controls built in!) This then means it's possible to find expertise in the company very easily.</li><br>

<br>
There are distinct parallels with the work I do in the corporate sector, and those in the education sector (which I inhabited as a teacher and product consultant for many years). So, I keep well-connected with my education colleagues, and have had many long discussions about the direction education is going in the UK and the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
It's time for those discussions to come out into the open. Rather than just talking about stuff, we've now got the opportunity to have a say directly into government.<br>
<br>
The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Secretary of State for Education, has recently announced a review of the primary and secondary National Curriculum in England. As part of this review the Department for Education has issued a <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/index.cfm?action=consultationDetails&amp;consultationId=1730&amp;external=no&amp;menu=1">vidence</a> asking for opinions and evidence that will start a national debate about what is taught in the schools of England.<br>
<br>
As an educational professional, school governor, policy maker, parent, carer, learner in England the above review affects you and the children under your care.<br>
<br>
If you are an employer in England it also affects you.<br>
<br>
In fact it's difficult to think of anybody that the outcome of this review does not touch in some way.<br>
<br>
<h3>How will you respond?</h3><br>
<br>
If you live anywhere near (or not so near) Chesterfield, you will be very welcome at an open meeting on the evening of 3rd March 2011.<br>
<br>
It will be an evening of discussion and debate about what should be taught in our schools.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this event is to engage participants in a discussion that will explore differing points of view about existing education provision and how it may be improved to encourage informed responses to the DfE's call.<br>
<br>
Each of our speakers will talk for 5-10 minutes about their personal position on what should be taught in our schools.<br>
<br>
This will be interspersed with some short videos and open discussion focussed on a number of key questions.<br>
<br>
The evening will allow you to debate with people who may have a differing viewpoint from your own.  We hope that new conversations will start, new opinions form and you will gain a better understanding of views that may be counter to your own.<br>

As an organisational function, it is having to <a href="http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/2010/12/operational-attitude-towards-learning.html">become far closer to Operational delivery</a> and to Internal Communications than to Human Resources.<br>
<br>
As a concept, organisations are beginning to realise that Learning &amp; Development is far wider than the formal training which has, up to now been the primary focus of investment.<br>
<br>
Over the past 40 years, research has consistently indicated that:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>70% of learning &amp; development activity takes place from real-life and on-the-job experiences, tasks and problem-solving.</li><br>
  <li>20% comes from feedback and from observing and working with role models.</li><br>
  <li>10% comes from formal training.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
(See: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/hr/learning/philosophy/">Princeton University's Learning Philosophy</a>)<br>
<br>
As an example see the recent report from Best Practice on <a href="http://goodpractice.com/white-papers/The-Learning-and-Performance-Link--How-managers-learn--in-their-own-words.pdf">how managers learn</a> (pdf).<br>
<br>
The Learning &amp; Development function within an organisation has a role to play in supporting each of these aspects, whilst, at the same time, understanding that control over the learning experience becomes devolved to the end-user for much of the time.<br>
<br>
<h3>On-the-job</h3><br>
<br>
In a rapidly changing work environment, employees need a range of tactics to help them adapt to different situations.<br>
<br>
These will often include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Asking someone who might know “the answer”</li><br>
  <li>Searching for (and finding!) information that will help them work out “the answer” – both from internal and external resources. (There is a strong relationship here with a knowledge management function)</li><br>
  <li>Trial-and-error</li><br>
  <li>Using a job-aid that has been prepared for this situation</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Learning from other people</h3><br>
<br>
Employees will maintain a network of peers, who can provide answers to questions, feedback and modelling of best behaviours.<br>
<br>
These may include their managers in a coaching relationship, but, more likely will be their direct peers, and, more often these days, will be people both inside and outside the organisation, with whom they have a virtual relationship.<br>
<br>
<h3>Formal training</h3><br>
<br>
The goal of all formal training is to change behaviours to match the organisation’s stated values. Here there is a strong relationship with internal communication and external marketing – to ensure that the messages going out to clients and shareholders match the reality of how the organisation works.<br>
<br>
Formal training may include:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Classroom workshops</li><br>
  <li>Lectures</li><br>
  <li>Online webinars</li><br>
  <li>Direct communications from “the centre”</li><br>
  <li>Designed learning experiences, such as simulations and tutorials</li><br>
  <li>Assessed activities</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
L&amp;D departments need to recognise these different ways of learning, develop ways to support them, and learn where to focus their investment to give the most return.<br>
<br>
That's probably the subject of another post, but, if you can't wait, read Clive Shepherd's book: <a href="http://onlignment.com/2011/01/meet-the-new-learning-architect/">The New Learning Architect</a></div><h1>Breaking down the classroom walls</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 February 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Often, when we think about the idea of introducing ICT into the classroom (whether in schools or in the workplace), we are simply thinking about ways to change what is happening inside the classroom.<br>
<br>
In these cases the role of the teacher or tutor tends to remain the same as pre-ICT days, as does the way teaching is managed and administered. Good teachers, who were already engaging their students with challenging activities, will continue to do so. Poor teachers, who bore their students rigid with lectures and "read-these-pages-in-the-text-book" activities will also carry on as before - except they'll now perhaps direct students to web-based resources.<br>
<br>
Those organisations that have <strong>really</strong> grasped the potential of ICT are using it to support systemic changes in the way they work.<br>
<br>
Some examples:<br>

In the education and training world, these examples seem to be fairly rare though.<br>
<br>
Let's think what <strong>could</strong> happen if we really used ICT to its full potential:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Teachers &amp; tutors would expect students to submit their work and receive feedback electronically. (Now that's easy - I really don't understand why we don't do it already?)</li><br>
  <li>We would only use physical classrooms/meeting rooms when we absolutely have to - when it's the only way to achieve something. Getting everyone together in the same room is using valuable resources both in terms of space and also people's time. Much of the time there is no point other than "it's what we've always done".</li><br>
  <li>We would share expertise across schools. But that would need all state-sector teachers to be paid centrally with no competition between schools. Perhaps that's a change too far? But why?</li><br>
  <li>We would be able to cope with children entering school when they are ready for it, and moving at the right pace for them - and not have to follow our current "sausage machine" processes that are simply designed to support administration and management rather than learning</li><br>
  <li>We would assess people when they are ready to be assessed, not at some arbitrary point in the year</li><br>
  <li>Teachers &amp; tutors would be expected to engage in, and contribute to, professional development networks</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
These are just a few ideas. What do you think would happen to your training or education organisation if we really allowed ICT to be used to its full potential?</div><h1>Arguing for consistent LMS platform APIs</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 February 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><blockquote>“If your only tool is a hammer, then every problem starts to look like a nail.” <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/abrahammas126079.html">Maslow</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
L&amp;D Departments need a toolkit that can support a wider range of learning activities than most L&amp;D departments are currently concerned with.<br>
<br>
Some of these tools may not be owned by L&amp;D, but by internal comms, or even IT. But L&amp;D will need to be aware of them, and have access to them.<br>
<br>
It might be possible to work on a small-pieces, loosely-joined approach, like that advocated by <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">David Weinberger</a>. That's a great approach for maximum flexibility and speed to change. But it doesn't make the best use of the masses of data that will accumulate in these systems, unless, like the consumer-focussed platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Ebay etc) you provide well-documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a> to allow communication between the tools.<br>
<br>
That data could then be mined to enable organisations to target support more effectively (the Facebook approach). If you knew what people were searching about and discussing, you could understand what the training needs were in your organisation.<br>
<br>
It could also be exposed to users to enable them to make more informed choices (the Amazon approach). By collecting data about collective behaviour, you can make recommendations to individuals.<br>
<br>
To achieve this, perhaps <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global</a> needs to start looking at wider scenarios than just formal training/learning, and begin to develop a set of simple APIs that vendors can sign up to for data transmission via web-services?<br>
<br>
That's a big ask. I know how long it takes to get agreement on anything like this...<br>
<br>
Of course, an alternative would be for the major players in the LMS and social learning market to get together and agree (<strong>and publish!</strong>) APIs that anyone can then adopt.<br>
<br>
That feels more feasible...<br>

<p>It's important for your learners, as searching is the main place people start these days when they want to find out something. Providing a page that pulls together results from inside your documents, from your course descriptions, and from content/posts provided by other people is by far the best way to get people to use your materials.</p><br>
<p>It's important for your content providers, as, with judicious placement of "important" items near the top of the list, you can encourage your learners to make more use of the centrally-provided content.</p><br>
<p>It's also important for the "business", as, by analysing what people are searching for, you've then got the equivalent of a training needs analysis (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ-bMbynst0">as discovered by Google</a> [watch from about 13:32 in the video] ) . This assumes you've got a reasonably-sized sample. If you have, then this is by far a simpler process than doing a full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_needs_analysis">TNA</a>.</p><br>
<div class="image_block"><a title="Wolfram Alpha computational search engine" href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/"><img src="./assets/wolfram_alpha.png" alt="" width="583" height="215"></a></div></div><h1>The LMS as a marketing tool</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 March 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>The model of learning and development provision, up till now, has generally been a "Push" approach. Learners get told by the managers, or compliance, or whoever, that they should do a particular course (whether face-to-face or elearning).</p><br>
<p>As we move towards more of a "Pull" approach, with learners taking far more responsibility for their own learning, our training departments will find that they are in stiff competition with many other (often far easier to access) sources of learning.</p><br>
<p>For example, why would I choose to go on a Management Development course, when I can, for free, get access to an excellent set of management development resources, as well as an active community of practice? (ie. <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager Tools</a>)</p><br>
<p>Why would I buy a course in HTML or CSS, or virtually any web programming language, when I've got free access to well-designed tutorials and resources? (ie. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>)</p><br>
<p>Our L&amp;D departments need to learn that they're now in the marketing game. They're not just selling to managers. They've got to sell to the learners themselves. This is especially true if your learners hold the L&amp;D budget and can spend it as they like...</p><br>
<p>The Learning Management System has (or <strong>should have</strong>) a key role to play in marketing your training interventions.(I don't like to use the word "courses" and L&amp;D is so much wider than just the course.)</p><br>
<p>Just think about the information contained within its walls:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>the content you're making available</li><br>
<li>learner roles</li><br>
<li>learner team relationships</li><br>
<li>what learners are searching for</li><br>
<li>what learners have bought or used</li><br>
<li>when they did their purchasing / using</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>At least, the LMS <strong>should</strong> be collecting this data... <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/digital/2010/08/networking-site-social-market">Facebook's market value of $33bn</a> is only that high because of the information it holds about its users. Why? Because it's highly valued by advertisers.</p><br>
<p>If our LMS's were doing their job properly, we'd see them looking less like process-driven, data entry systems and more like Amazon. In the image in this post (click on it for a larger version), I've highlighted some of the key things that Amazon does that could easily be transferred to an L&amp;D scenario:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Global search - available from the home page onwards</li><br>
<li>Ubiquitous catalogue - with all products classified as learners would understand</li><br>
<li>Products able to appear in multiple categories</li><br>
<li>Promoted products appearing prominently</li><br>
<li>Links to products that learners have looked at but not yet bought</li><br>
<li>Links to products that the learners have expressed a greater interest in but not yet bought</li><br>
<li>Links to products that are related to ones the learner has looked at</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>There's more that's hidden inside the system:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Recommendations based on previous purchases</li><br>
<li>Learners able to sort and filter search results by best-selling, ratings, price</li><br>
<li>In our case, perhaps the ability to filter based on location, length, pre-requisites, level, qualification, whether online or face-to-face</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>I've been talking to a lot of learning technology vendors over the past few years, and I'm amazed how few seem to have understood the extent to which the learner is now in control, not just of their learning, but of the money that's being spent on it.</p><br>
<p>If they don't make their systems as easy to use as Amazon, Ebay, Youtube or even Wordpress - putting the user at the centre of the experience and building an effective marketing platform - then they will paint themselves into a corner that consists exclusively of "Push" training where budgets are held centrally.</p><br>
<p>I'm sure that's not a realistic way of doing business in the future?</p><br>

<p>This is a model that's been working reasonably well in workplace training for a number of years now. It <strong>does</strong> rely on there being some sort of motivating influence to do the pre-work though. Generally, given the choice, most people will just rely on being able to bluff their way through the classroom session.</p><br>
<p>The key thing is “appropriate use” of the resources at our disposal. It’s about enabling <strong>flexibility</strong> of choice for the teacher and for the learner.</p><br>
<p>We need to balance financial cost with the effective and efficient use of time, and with the underlying motivational level of our students/trainees.</p><br>
<p>We need to consider whether 1:1 coaching would work best for a particular student/context, or whether a small group discussion, or even a 1:many lecture.</p><br>
<p>The problem with much of our educational/training infrastructure is that it’s built on a highly inflexible classroom-based model of teaching. The investment has already been made in those buildings and the administration processes that surround them.</p><br>
<p>To become more flexible, some of these ways of working will need to be torn down before they can be rebuilt.</p><br>
<p>I can imagine a training or educational organisation that is based around a problem-based curriculum, which uses small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning">Action Learning Sets</a>, coaching, online lectures, searchable resource libraries, inspirational speakers (like TED talks), informal conversations and a whole host of other types of interactions in different sized groups. It would be complex. Sometimes it would appear chaotic. It would certainly be an interesting one to manage. But it would relate far more to the real world than our closed classrooms with a trainer/teacher and delegates/students.</p></div><h1>Raising money for the Big Issue Foundation</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 March 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div style="float: right; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f00; padding: 15px; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;"><a href="http://my.artezglobal.com/personalPage.aspx?SID=310589&amp;Lang=en-CA">Donate via the secure fundraising page</a></div><br>

<br>
Like <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/12/02/being-creative-in-a-digital-world-follow-up?blog=5">last time</a>, we used Webex, and again followed (roughly!) the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/11/01/being-creative-in-digital-world?blog=5">structure outlined here</a>.<br>
<br>
The conversation ranged widely - with only four people it meant there was a fair bit of scope for discussion.<br>
<br>
We discussed how, when working in the social media space, having an authentic voice is absolutely critical. I recommended reading the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> (free download), as it really opens up how organisations should connect with their markets.<br>
<br>
We considered how to get the best out of tools like Twitter, Yammer and Socialcast. As I wrote in my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/04/29/yammer-best-practice-guide-yam?blog=5">Best Practice Guide to Yammer</a>:<br>
<blockquote>You walk into a conference room. It's your first time at this particular conference and there's no welcome pack. You can see quite a few people standing around drinking coffee and eating small pastries. But no-one's talking to each other.<br>
You have three options:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Turn around and walk out.</li><br>
  <li>Find someone you know and begin a conversation about one of the conference themes.</li><br>
  <li>Introduce yourself to someone you don't know and look for areas of common interest</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Social media tools can sometimes feel like that conference room. For many people it's a strange new environment. There are no clear rules on how to behave or what to do. We know the value of networking, but doing that online can be daunting at times.</blockquote><br>
<br>
We also looked at how <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english">RSS feeds</a> can make it a lot easier to keep up to date, maintain your connections with your information sources, to filter out what you don't need to see and to share what you've learnt. (See <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2010/03/pkm-in-a-nutshell/">Harold Jarche's guide to Personal Knowledge Management</a>). The key thing is to find your trusted sources, and the best way to do that is through personal recommendation, but also to seek out those sources who do not necessarily agree with your own point of view.<br>
<br>
We then went on to think about how the tools at our disposal encourage creativity across organisational and even national boundaries. The first couple of minutes of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation.html">Chris Anderson's talk at TED</a> really highlights this in the context of dance - through Youtube kids are sharing moves and building on what they're learning.<br>
<br>
We looked at tools that are making it easier to share content:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>Content creation tools like the <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip camera</a>, <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>, <a href="http://piratepad.net/">PiratePad</a> (collaborative writing)<br>
</li><li>Content sharing tools like <a href="http://www.slideshare.com/">Slideshare</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> (where quality seems to be more the norm than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (for images) </li><br>
  <li>Mind-mapping/brainstorming tools like <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">Mindmeister</a>, <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/">Personal Brain</a>, <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/">CmapTools</a>, <a href="http://bubbl.us/">Bubbl.us</a> and <a href="http://www.text2mindmap.com/">Text2MindMap</a></li><br>
  <li>Knowledge aggregation tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>, <a href="http://addictomatic.com/">Addictomatic</a></li><br>
  <li>Productivity tools like <a href="http://www.doodle.com/">Doodle</a> (for meeting scheduling) and <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/">YouSendIt</a> (for moving large files around), <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> (for seeing how people are using your stuff)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
More tools in the extensive list on <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html"> Jane Hart's directory</a> - <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/articles/30ways.pdf">summarised beautifully in this PDF</a><br>
<br>
We made the point that free tools might not necessarily be appropriate for large-scale use. You need to understand the business model as well as the risks of putting your data on servers you know nothing about.<br>
<br>
Finally, one of the delegates highlighted an example of a truly collaborative and creative project, the <a href="http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/">Johnny Cash Project</a><br>
<br>
As with all these sorts of workshops there's no real end result, other than an increased awareness of what is possible. It's then up to the individuals to then go work out what will work for them, in their context.</div><h1>Xyleme Voices podcast: Getting the most from your LMS</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 27 March 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href="http://www.xyleme.com/podcasts/wp/podpress_trac/web/33/0/Podcast21_Mark_Berthelemy.mp3">http://www.xyleme.com/podcasts/wp/podpress_trac/web/33/0/Podcast21_Mark_Berthelemy.mp3</a></p>I had the privilege recently of making a podcast with the team from <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/podcasts">Xyleme Voices</a>.<br>
<br>
From the podcast blurb:<br>
<blockquote>Mark ... makes the case that companies are spending thousands of dollars on creating training content but they are locking it away in their Learning Management System (LMS). In today’s podcast Mark will be discussing how to get more from your LMS.<br>
<br>
In the corporate learning context, Mark argues that learners cannot quickly get the information they need because the content they require is sitting inside the company’s LMS without the ability to search for it. Mark explains how the problem lies not with the system itself, but with how it is used in conjunction with other systems and he offers his advice on how corporations can best address this issue in the workplace.</blockquote><br>

<br>
It can be really hard to help your clients understand what they're going to get. So, quite often, even at the pre-sales stage, software designers build mock-up designs. This approach can be fraught with problems - especially if you haven't yet got a good feel for what the client's real needs are.<br>
<br>
Particularly problematic is the expectation that these mock-ups raise. As designers we want to show off all the glitzy features that are possible. If we do it too well, this then becomes the end product, with very little room to manoeuvre.<br>
<br>
Elearning designers are particularly at risk, with their "rapid-development" tools. Unless you've got a very good relationship with the client, that allows an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development approach</a>, then you'll probably be trapped into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall design methodology</a>. But, if you've given your client a view of the finished-product up-front, then you won't be able to respond to what you later discover about the client's requirements.<br>
<br>
This is where <a href="http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq Mockups</a> comes in.<br>
<br>
It's an inexpensive software tool that allows you to create page/application designs quickly, with end results that look like hand-drawn screen diagrams, like the one below.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/balsamiq_screenshot.png"><img alt="Balsamiq mockups sample" src="./assets/balsamiq_screenshot.png" width="500"></a></div><br>
<br>
Screens can be linked together, so you can easily demonstrate user workflows, and even create interactive PDFs.<br>
<br>
There are <a href="http://balsamiq.com/support/community">third-party tools</a> that enable you to create real code from the mockups (although I've not tested any of these!)<br>
<br>
Virtually any interface element can be quickly and easily built from the pre-built element library, but there's also a <a href="http://mockupstogo.net/">community-generated</a> set of UI components.<br>
<br>
I've tried <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a>, which is a similar tool, but far more expensive and complex. Axure is in the next league up, and designed for helping project teams build major applications. For a small team, or an individual designer, in most cases it's probably a bit over-kill.<br>
<br>
Balsamiq is invaluable for showing clients what is possible, but without the impression that they're seeing a finished product.<br>
<br>
There is just a couple of things I hope the team at Balsamiq implement at some point:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Managing large projects can become awkward, as the only way to navigate between pages is through the tabs at the bottom of the screen. This quickly become overcrowded. I believe this is on the roadmap, but then large projects might be better managed with Axure and other, similarly-priced products.</li><br>
  <li>At the moment, if you need to change a menu item that appears on every page of an application, you have to manually change it in each Balsamiq page. There needs to be some way of templating common UI elements so that you only need to change them once for the whole project. Again, it looks like Balsamiq are working on this. I'm looking forward to seeing it soon!<br>
<br>
[EDIT: @Balsamiq has informed me that the new <a href="http://balsamiq.com/support/documentation/symbols">"symbols" feature</a> allows just this functionality!]</li><br>

So, overall, a great little tool. If you've ever needed to build a quick website or application layout and not wanted to worry about code or colours, then I'd highly recommend Balsamiq Mockups.<br>
<br>
For those viewing this in an RSS reader, there's a video below that shows some of the key features. And, if Balsamiq want to sponsor me for the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/02/28/big-issue-bike-ride?blog=5">Big Issue Bike Ride</a> that would be very gratefully received (although this post was written without any expectation of sponsorship, and I'd have said the same things anyway!)<br>

We are told that each one, whether its hardware or software, is better, faster or more useful than the one before.<br>
<br>
But change comes at a price. It's fine if it's just you and your wallet. That's your decision. But when other people are involved, whether it's your clients, your team, or even your whole organisation, then any change needs to be carefully managed.<br>
<br>
The more complex your setup, the harder you'll have to work to prove that the change is either necessary or low impact.<br>
<br>
Somewhere you'll need a list of everyone that might need to be consulted - every system, business process, and technology that might be impacted by the change you're wanting to introduce.<br>
<br>
This is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management_database">Configuration Management Databases (CMDB)</a> come in. They keep a record of "Configuration Items", their relationships with each other, and any changes that have been applied to them. This then allows organisations to build change management processes with information flowing to the right people at the right time in order to gain approval for changes.<br>
<br>
CMDB's are a core part of <a href="http://www.itil-officialsite.com/">ITIL™ (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)</a>, which, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2" title="Wikipedia article">PRINCE2</a>™ (for project and programme management) comes from the UK's Office of Government Commerce.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>ITIL gives detailed descriptions of a number of important IT practices and provides comprehensive checklists, tasks and procedures that any IT organisation can tailor to its needs. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">From ITIL on Wikipedia 27/4/11</a>)</blockquote><br>
<br>
Configuration management is the part of ITIL that ensures that any changes to configuration items are appropriately:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Identified</li><br>
  <li>Planned</li><br>
  <li>Assessed</li><br>
  <li>Approved</li><br>
  <li>Tested</li><br>
  <li>Communicated</li><br>
  <li>Released</li><br>
  <li>Maintained</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
The object is to ensure a stable system, that continues to meet the needs of the organisation, whilst adapting to changes in the environment.<br>
<br>
Configuration items don't just mean bits of technology (whether software or hardware). They also include core business processes (eg. when and how the organisation communicates with clients, or the process by which a certification is gained by a learner).<br>
<br>
It's also important to realise that no, one, database is going to contain all the information about all your systems and processes. For example, you will probably have a inventory database that is separate, but needs to be known to (and queryable by) the CMDB.<br>
<br>
The solution adopted by <a href="http://www.combodo.com/">Combodo</a> (a French IT Services company) is shown below:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.combodo.com/-Solution,18-.html"><img alt="Combodo solution" src="./assets/Schema_iTop-08317.png" width="450" height="458"></a></div><br>
<br>
It's based around their open-source <a href="http://www.combodo.com/-Overview-.html">iTop</a> CMDB.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.combodo.com/-Screenshots-.html"><img alt="iTop Screenshot" src="./assets/iTop_impact.jpg" width="500" height="226"></a></div><br>
<br>
If you're working in a place where open source (specifically PHP) applications are accepted and used, then I'd recommend taking a look at iTop. As well as configuration management, it also handles incidents, changes, service contracts (for suppliers and customers), known issues, outage notification, and issue notification from end-users.<br>
<br>
iTop is designed for people who are offering IT Services to a number of client organisations, and provides dashboards and reporting across all clients and for specific clients.<br>
<br>
Although, by necessity, the application is complex, it has a consistent and easy to learn interface. To get the best out of it though, you'll need a decent grounding in the ITIL processes - just to help you make decisions about where to store which bits of information.</div><h1>UK Mediation sponsors the Big Issue London to Paris bike ride</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 May 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><a href="http://www.ukmediation.net/">UK Mediation</a>, a national mediation services and training company has kindly sponsored me for the <a href="http://www.bigissue.com/events.php?eventid=21">Big Issue London to Paris Bike Ride</a>.<br>

It's similar to the discussions schools had (or in most cases didn't have!) when the last government's Interactive WhiteBoard funding came in.<br>
<br>
In many cases, the talk is focussed on the glitz that technology brings. "It'll make us look modern... up-to-date."<br>
<br>
There's often very little discussion about the real place for technology in learning.<br>
<br>
The classroom is probably the worst place to put technology. You're wasting the valuable time where you've got a group of people in the same room. That time should be spent conversing, listening and discussing, not interacting with screens or with people outside of the room.<br>
<br>
Yes, there will be times when the facilitator (or one of the delegates) wants to demonstrate something, or show a video to help with a particular point. But that should be the exception.<br>
<br>
In general, I would argue that the ideal position is that all technology (apart from pens and paper) is left outside the classroom. And that includes Powerpoint!<br>
<br>
It means you focus on the people and the conversation in the room, rather than on what's happening outside.<br>
<br>
What this means is that, when there's content to be digested, reflections to be written up, or conversations to happen with people outside of the classroom, this should happen outside of the time allocated for the classroom.<br>
<br>
For example, let's take a workshop that's designed to "train" people how to do performance appraisals...<br>
<br>
<h3>Before the workshop:</h3><br>
<br>
Produce materials (audio, video, written, whatever) that will get people thinking about the process, and about the issues they'll need to address.<br>
<br>
Make it totally clear that the workshop will not be re-presenting those things.<br>
<br>
<h3>During the workshop:</h3><br>
<br>
Highlight the key issues, get people talking about the questions raised, and practice the bits that need practicing (eg. how to give feedback). Use a printed mind map or concept map if you need something to hang the discussion on.<br>
<br>
<h3>After the workshop:</h3><br>
<br>
Encourage delegates to reflect in a public space on what they've learnt. You could even make this a condition of getting an attendance certificate!<br>
<br>
Using this approach will make far better use of the time available, and be far more effective in terms of what delegates are able to do afterwards. It also means that your classroom sessions will become seen as a much more valuable part of what you're offering.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is an ideal situation, that depends on a whole host of cultural and organisational factors. In reality, there's probably still a place for technology in the classroom, for the moment anyway...</div><h1>Fusion Universal sponsors the Big Issue London to Paris Bike Ride</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>The people at <a href="http://www.fusion-universal.com/">Fusion Universal</a> - one of the most innovative online learning companies I know - have kindly sponsored me for the <a href="http://www.bigissue.com/events.php?eventid=21">Big Issue London to Paris Bike Ride</a>.<br>

It's not a bad T-shirt at all; quite comfortable and easy to wear.<br>
<br>
But wearing it in public makes me feel rather uneasy, as the words on it run counter to what I believe is true:<br>
<blockquote><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Learning Made Easy</h2><br>
&nbsp;<br>
</blockquote><br>
It's just that learning - that process through which connections are made in the brain - isn't easy...<br>
<br>
It takes concentration, dedication, and, often, mistakes, over a period of time. If something is easy to learn, then that should raise questions about the value of that thing.<br>
<br>
I'm going on a course next week. The first for a long time. It's on the <a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk/methods_prince_2.asp">PRINCE2™ project management methodology</a>.<br>
<br>
Given what I've read of the pre-work, this is going to be a hard week. There's a lot to get my head around, to apply to my current practice, and to remember for an exam on Friday.<br>
<br>
But that's a good thing. It means that the Practitioner certificate I'm hoping to gain will mean something. It will have value. Similarly, the expectation is that what I learn on the course will add value to the work I do.<br>
<br>
If I was told that learning PRINCE2™ methodologies was easy, then why would I go on a five day course? I'd look it up and muddle through (as I have done up to now!)<br>
<br>
But, because I want an in-depth understanding, so I can use PRINCE2™ properly and appropriately, I'm going to make an effort.<br>
<br>
Learning isn't easy. Not for the learner.</div><h1>Reflections on Prince2 training</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>As you'll know from my <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/06/11/learning-made-easy?blog=5">previous post</a>, I've spent the last week on a rather intensive Prince2® training course.<br>
<br>
It was an interesting experience... <br>
<br>
It was the first time I've done a course that was solely focussed on the exam at the end of it since my degree (and that one wasn't a pleasant experience). But this course was only four days long, followed by a 2 1/2 hour in-depth, but open-book exam of our understanding of the concepts.<br>
<br>
I've always had mixed feelings about exams, but I think this one really worked as an assessment method. Mainly because it was open-book, so it really was testing how well we understood how the Prince2 principles, themes, management products and processes all fitted together.<br>
<br>
Where the course fell down (and this is no reflection on the provider, as it's just the nature of this particular qualification), is that there was no space to explore with each other how Prince2 could really work in practice.<br>
<br>
I really felt like I could do with another couple of days after the exam to work through some case studies or simulations. Or, even better, one of my own projects.<br>
<br>
But Prince2 is designed to be tailored to specific projects, so what works for one person wouldn't necessarily work for someone else.<br>
<br>
So, the next few weeks and months are going to be a bit of a "journey" to make Prince2 fit my own projects, with guidance from those people around me who are more experienced...<br>
<br>
Thankfully I'm in a place where Prince2 is pretty much embedded already (so I now realise), so there are a lot of people I can call on! They have been warned!<br>
<br>
The other thing I was thinking about was how people using Prince2 would benefit very much from a hyperlinked version of the OGC manual. There's a lot of flicking backwards and forwards, but with little cross-referencing to help. If anyone knows of an existing site please let me know.<br>
<br>
And finally, as I was working through the material I kept thinking about how useful it would be to have a piece of software (preferably web-based) that helped project managers to manage all the processes. It wouldn't necessarily have all the pieces within it (eg. there are already very good <a href="http://www.teamst.org/">quality</a>, <a href="http://owl.anytimecomm.com/">document</a>, <a href="http://www.php-collab.com/blog/">planning</a> and <a href="http://www.combodo.com/?lang=en">configuration</a> management tools that would just need an interface) but it would provide a central location (a portal even) for the project team to see their view on the project.<br>
<br>
The only one I'm aware of is <a href="http://www.mosaiquegroup.com/Aspyre_Portfolio_Programme_Project_Management_and_PMO_Software.html">Aspyre</a>, which is very good, but I'd be interested to know what else is out there - especially if it was open source.</div><h1>Rail passengers - claim what you're entitled to!</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 20 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>About twice a week at the moment, I'm to be found travelling on <a href="http://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/">East Midlands Trains</a> between Derby and London.<br>
<br>
Usually it's a pretty good service, but occasionally things go wrong and my journey gets delayed. That's fine - these things happen.<br>
<br>
What I can't excuse, though, is the total lack of communication from the train managers about the <a href="http://www.passengerfocus.org.uk/advice-and-complaints/your-rights/">compensation that passengers are entitled to</a>. You can tell that most people don't know, because, at the end of the journey, they're putting their tickets in the gates to get out of the station. Without tickets as evidence, no train operating company (TOC) is going to pay anything.<br>
<br>
To be honest, <a href="http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/passengers-charter1/Delay-Repay/">East Midlands Trains "Delay-Repay" policy</a> is pretty generous. But you have to ASK FOR THE CLAIM FORM. No-one will volunteer any information about it.<br>
<br>
In my experience it's the same with every TOC. They all have a compensation policy, but they won't tell you.</div><h1>Social media @ work</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This is a great little video from <a href="http://www.redskyvision.com/">Red Sky Vision</a>, via <a href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2011/06/social-media-work-video.html">Jane Hart</a>.<br>

From the blurb:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>There is disconnect between how immersed and digitally connected employees are outside of the workplace, and how their internal communications are being delivered. On the ground, employees are still posting printed communications on the water cooler when they can be engaged, led and informed via the latest digital channel.</blockquote><br>
<br>
And a great quote from the video:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"Organisations are inherently risk averse. My grandfather ran a business where he didn't want everybody having a telephone. He was afraid they'd spend all day talking to their mother."</blockquote><br>
<br>
Sounds silly now, doesn't it. Just as it will sound silly in a few years when we talk about Facebook, Twitter et al being blocked, or about not having organisation-specific social media tools.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Approximately 2/3 of corporate intranets now have some form of social media capability.</blockquote><br>

<br>
<a href="http://donaldhtaylor.wordpress.com/">Donald Taylor</a> was giving a very succinct overview of the state of organisational learning and development. In it he said:<br>
<blockquote>Yes, courses are necessary - but they are not sufficient.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Wow! Dig into that and you've got the whole problem we have currently with organisational learning summarised in eight words.<br>
<br>
Organisations expect courses, managers don't like to pay for courses, L&amp;D teams are funded based on the courses they deliver, learners don't value courses (unless they lead to a qualification).<br>
<br>
So, all we get is courses. Which we, in L&amp;D, know aren't the whole answer. (At least, I hope you're at that point. If not, see: Michael Wesch's video "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCJ46vyR9o">A vision of students today</a>". If you're still not convinced read <a href="http://stuff4educators.com/index.php?p=1_13_Long-term-Memory">this article on long term memory</a> - especially the bit about the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve)<br>
<br>
As well as courses, L&amp;D should be involved in the following:<br>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr>
<th width="20%">&nbsp;</th>
<th width="40%">For individual learners</th>
<th width="40%">For the organisation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Support systems - demonstrating best practice, without being a bottleneck</td>
<td>Performance consulting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capability &amp; Talent</td>
<td>Coaching, mentoring</td>
<td>Monitoring, assessment, development programmes</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Learning</td>
<td>Learning to learn programmes - how to search, how to connect with people, thinking skills, note taking, personal knowledge management etc</td>
<td>Developing a learning culture (which, of course, is far wider than L&amp;D as it's just part of the whole organisational and management culture)</td>

</tr>
</tbody></table><br>
<br>
<strong>But, who will pay for all this?</strong> All the time L&amp;D is seen as a transactional part of the business, supplying products (courses in our case) to order, then no-one.<br>
<br>
If L&amp;D is going to be able to drive some of the thinking away from courses, it needs to have a seat where decisions are made. This would allow L&amp;D professionals (not trainers!) to offer solutions that really would make a difference.<br>
<br>
To get that seat at the table will take time, and quite a few changes within L&amp;D departments - not least taking the risky position of saying "Why?" when someone asks you to put on a course.</div><h1>Corporate IT - competing in a consumer-focussed world</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 30 June 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There was a time, not too long ago, when the only exposure normal people had to Information Technology was at work.<br>
<br>
We didn't have the internet or email in our homes, but we may have had it at work.<br>
<br>
Everything was tightly controlled - to conserve valuable bandwidth and resources (both digital and human).<br>
<br>
At that point, we had nothing to compare against. If we were given a green DOS screen to carry out our work that was fine. We might have thought some of the commands were a bit hard to remember but nothing that couldn't be fixed by a cheat sheet.<br>
<br>
Now, however, we are often carrying around in our pockets IT systems that are more powerful and more connected than those provided by our employers. With them we can immediately look up information, ask questions of our peers around the world, share ideas through video, collaborate on documents, carry out complex operations on our bank accounts, and even remotely control equipment in our homes.<br>
<br>
All these applications have one thing in common: If they are to take off they need to have as few barriers to usage as possible.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral Balkan</a> has written extensively on user interface design. I've copied his key points below, but look up the <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/687">source article</a> if you want the detail.<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>The Client Is Not The User</li><br>
  <li>Don't Give The Client What She Thinks The User Wants</li><br>
  <li>You Do Not Know What Your User Wants</li><br>
  <li>Only Users Know What Users Want</li><br>
  <li>Test Early, Test Often, Then Test Again</li><br>
  <li>Talk One Language</li><br>
  <li>Respect User Effort</li><br>
  <li>Make Difficult Decisions</li><br>
  <li>Let The User Work</li><br>
  <li>Prevent, Don't Scold</li><br>
  <li>Give Sufficient Feedback</li><br>
  <li>Show, Don't Tell</li><br>
  <li>Don't Lose The User</li><br>
  <li>Don't Sell What You Can't Deliver</li><br>
  <li>Don't Keep Them Waiting</li><br>
  <li>Innocent Until Proven Guilty</li><br>
  <li>Usability Approach to Accessibility</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
For some more ideas, see <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/application-mistakes.html">Jakob Nielsen's post on design mistakes</a>.<br>
<br>
Applications that rely on users to keep using them follow these principles closely. These include the consumer applications we have on our personal computers, phones and tablets (whether browser-based or not).<br>
<br>
But it also includes the new breed of corporate "Cloud"-based Software-As-A-Service applications, such as Kashflow, Salesforce, Cornerstone etc. If people don't use them the client will think long and hard about renewing their license each year.<br>
<br>
Those applications that sit inside our corporate firewalls seem to be excluded from these design principles. They might be fit for purpose, but often they don't encourage use.<br>
<br>
A couple of examples that I've come across in my travels:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A Learning Management System that doesn't allow people to link directly to a particular course. This means that, to market courses (whether virally or otherwise), all you can do is give people the link to the corporate self-service portal, and then provide instructions on where to go next. At least six clicks (in various esoteric parts of the screen) and two popup windows later, you might get to where you want to go.</li><br>
  <li>An internal document library that was so hard to use that employees would use Google to find out information about the organisation rather than trawl through the official internal documents.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
It goes back to Aral's first five points. IT depts need to get closer to us, their users. It's not that we can go elsewhere at the moment, to be honest. But it's about inspiring confidence to ask them for future developments, and about getting most value from what we already have.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't happen, there are plenty of providers of consumer-grade systems out in the cloud who can do what corporate IT offer. And then it's just a matter of deciding whether you risk your data there... (but that's for another day!)</div><h1>Who pays your project manager?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 4 July 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Following my Prince2 training, I've gained a new appreciation for the role of the Project Manager.

<div class="image_block"><img alt="Prince2 Organisation" src="./assets/Prince2_org.png" width="500" height="500"><p>Prince2 Organisation</p></div><br>
<br>
That appeared to run counter to most people's experience. It seemed logical that the PM is best coming from the supplier, since they understand what's needed and when.<br>
<br>
Take a house building project for example. An inexperienced client would love to have a builder who offered to project manage all the sub-contractors.<br>
<br>
However, there's a major conflict of priorities here. The PM should always have the client's interests at heart. If they get their pay cheque from the supplier, then that may become difficult.<br>
<br>
Prince2 does allow exceptions to this rule - but only if additional project assurance processes are put in place, to make sure the project is being run correctly.<br>
<br>
No wonder good, independent project managers - skilled in specific domains - are worth their weight in gold!</div><h1>Information systems management workshop</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 July 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'm shortly to be leading a short workshop on information systems management.<br>
<br>
Topics under discussion will be:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>database design</li><br>
  <li>user interface design</li><br>
  <li>information architecture</li><br>
  <li>collaborative information management</li><br>
  <li>working with suppliers</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
I've put some notes below about the sorts of things I'm likely to cover - but I'd welcome any additional input on useful points or resources.<br>
<br>
<h3>Database design</h3><br>
<br>
Write once - read many. There should only be one place you put each piece of data. This is the difference between a spreadsheet and a relational database.<br>
<br>
When designing your database, try to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">normalise</a> it as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Normalisation tries to ensure that:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>No data is unnecessarily duplicated</li><br>
  <li>Data is consistent throughout the database</li><br>
  <li>Queries can be created to easily pull out data from related tables</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
(from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg7r3DgS3rA)<br>
<br>
Then use lookups or relationships to pull those pieces of data in when they are required.<br>
<br>
<h3>User Interface design</h3><br>
<br>
Too big a topic to cover fully in one workshop. But I'll highlight Steve Krug's book: <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don't make me think</a> - probably the best introduction to usability I've come across.<br>
<br>
Two key principles:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Consistency: follow conventions where possible. Where not, make sure you keep your own conventions</li><br>
  <li>Simplicity: focus on the user's need at that point in time</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">User-centred design</a> is key, such as personas, use cases and ongoing usability testing.<br>
<br>
Much depends on whether the system will be mandated or optional. If it's optional, you really need to make an effort on interface design, otherwise people will go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<h3>Information architecture</h3><br>
<br>
Will your information be hierarchical - in separate silos to organise - or flat - using metadata tags.<br>
<br>
Hierarchies allow for drilling down, and for visualising data.<br>
<br>
Tags allow information to sit in more than one place and connections to be made between different information elements.<br>
<br>
Combining the two brings in the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search">Faceted Search</a> - often seen in ecommerce sites, eg. http://www.johnlewis.com<br>
<br>
<h3>Collaborative information management</h3><br>
<br>
Examples include Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.<br>
<br>
By allowing information users to generate, tag and refine information - the final result can become more useful.<br>
<br>
See James Suroweicki's book - <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/">The Wisdom of Crowds</a><br>
<br>
Examples include Google's approach to tagging and finding expertise. You are tagged by your peers with your expertise - rather than telling your peers what you are an expert in.<br>
<br>
Questions include: What controls and feedback loops need to be put in place that allow the process to happen, yet reduce the risk of mis-information.<br>
<br>
<h3>Working with suppliers</h3><br>
<br>
Here you need to be considering issues such as data protection, information security, cost, time, project management processes etc.<br>
<br>
It's a matter of finding the supplier who has a similar attitude to risk that you have. But being prepared to pay for high quality and low risk.</div><h1>Big Issue Bike Ride - finished!</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 July 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Over Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week, along with 140 other people, I cycled a total of 240 miles from London to Paris.<br>
<br>
Our team of Capita colleagues raised over £5000 for the Big Issue, and we were that over £200,000 has been raised overall. It was the biggest fund raising event the <a href="http://www.bigissue.com/">Big Issue Foundation</a> has ever done.<br>
<br>
The whole thing was professionally run with excellent support teams with all the food and drink we needed, along with spare parts, tools, mechanics and medics!<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who sponsored me for their support. You can find a list of my corporate sponsors on the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/">home page of the Learning Conversations site</a>.<br>

<br>
I agree totally with them that users' expectations of IT, and particularly the ability to innovate quickly, have increased exponentially - far beyond what IT departments within large organisations can often handle.<br>
<br>
Already I'm coming across situations where organisations are adamant that they wish to keep their IT departments well away from projects, because they know full well that involvement from IT will result in hugely increased costs, and massively extended timescales.<br>
<br>
The question is, how to achieve innovation whilst still maintaining robust and secure systems across the board, and with an eye to bringing innovative projects into the mainstream if they're successful?<br>
<br>
Any tips?</div><h1>IT Toolkit for a Learning Organisation #LearningLive</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 August 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'll be running a workshop at this year's <a href="http://conference.screencastacademy.com/">Learning Live</a> conference in September (13th &amp; 14th in Birmingham if you're interested!)<br>
<br>
During the workshop, I'll be focussing on key processes such as:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Maintaining effective customer and supplier relationships</li><br>
  <li>Managing face-to-face and online delivery of formal events</li><br>
  <li>Forecasting and monitoring revenue and costs</li><br>
  <li>Providing learners with access to up-to-date resources</li><br>
  <li>Supporting informal learning</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
But, when choosing any IT system to support your business, you need to consider at least the following three questions alongside your functional requirements:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Do you need the system to be able to cope with inputs from multiple users, or just from single, unconnected users?</li><br>
  <li>If server-based, do you need the system to be hosted inside or outside of your organisation's firewall?</li><br>
  <li>Would you prefer to go for a multi-functional tool, or a set of best-of-breed tools?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
I'll be asking the participants at the workshop to discuss the advantages of each of these approaches. So, this is a heads-up to any people planning on attending to get your thinking hats on ;-)<br>
<br>
Of course, if you want to think in advance, please feel free to comment below.<br>

<p>Most of the accepted work on adoption of innovations has been carried out by Everett M. Rodgers. His book “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diffusion-Innovations-Everett-M-Rogers/dp/0743222091">Diffusion of Innovations</a>” is the classic and has been widely quoted. It was first published in 1962 and is still in print.</p><br>
<p>This theoretical background helps us to develop a methodology that is more likely to succeed; by allowing us to focus on key user groups, and to highlight the benefits the innovation will have for those groups.</p><br>
<p>It provides three key dimensions to an implementation framework:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>The adoption process – ie. where the individual is on the spectrum of knowing nothing to using fully;</li><br>
<li>The characteristics of the innovation in question that will influence the individual to adopt or reject it;</li><br>
<li>The characteristics of the individual – ie. where they are on the spectrum of being first to innovate through to being last to change.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>These dimensions are described in below (using detail taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">Wikipedia</a>, but based on Rodgers’ book), along with the actions that would be taken to support each stage.</p><br>

<h3>Characteristics of innovations</h3><br>
<p>Rogers defines several intrinsic characteristics of innovations that influence an individual’s decision to adopt or reject an innovation. These characteristics help us to define the content of any communication about the benefits of the innovation.</p><br>

<h3>Characteristics of the individual</h3><br>
<p>Rogers identified five categories of adopters within a particular social group, which are useful to those promoting change, as they help us to identify groups of people to target.

Innovators are willing to take risks, youngest in age, have the   highest social class, have great financial lucidity, very social and have   closest contact to scientific sources and interaction with other innovators.

<td width="259" valign="top"><br>
<p>This group may need to be forced to use the innovation by   making it the only way that they can complete certain tasks which are   important to them.</p><br>

<h3>Communication process</h3><br>
<p>Most system rollouts only look at communicating with users once the rollout is ready to begin. This is too late. It's far better to start that communication process as early as possible.</p><br>
<p>This communication should be two way. Effective system rollouts need to listen to users via a consistent feedback loop that is easily accessible to end users.</p><br>
<p>I'd recommend that there is someone on board who is responsible for community engagement. Ideally that person will already have quite a good network within the organisation.</p><br>
<p>The community engagement manager will have a number of roles that tend to follow a repeating cycle:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>Listen to “war stories” about how the technology is being used</li><br>
<li>Reflect those war stories back into the community and ask questions</li><br>
<li>Get to the heart of any problems – whether technical or cultural – and discuss those problems with the user community</li><br>
<li>Set expectations, without over-promising</li><br>
<li>Demonstrate the technology in action – being the lead champion</li><br>
<li>Find the “pinch points” – situations where the technology does not live up to expectations</li><br>
<li>Respond to issues that you hear about by providing easily accessible work-arounds or advice</li><br>
<li>Find the success stories and disseminate them</li><br>
<li>Gather people who will become the technology champions around the organisation</li><br>
<li>Aggregate and disseminate knowledge from the other champions – give them recognition as experts.</li><br>
<li>Make sure the community is made aware of any issues with the technology as soon as they arise</li><br>
</ol><br>
<h3>Training activities</h3><br>
<p>The training element of any technology implementation includes all the people-centred training and communications activity that is not directly related to purchasing boxes or writing code.</p><br>
<p>Ideally, these activities are built-in at the start of the project, and should consider:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Awareness-raising communications</li><br>
<li>User documentation</li><br>
<li>Local champions</li><br>
<li>Context sensitive help</li><br>
<li>Telephone support</li><br>
<li>Self-service support portal</li><br>
<li>Ongoing hints and tips</li><br>
<li>User forums</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>Not all of the above are appropriate in every situation. Yet all should be considered at the start of the project.</p></div><h1>Twitter as your main learning tool? I still don't get it</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 11 August 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>For two years now, Jane Hart's collation of the <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/top-tools/top-100-tools-for-learning-2011/">Top 100 Tools for Learning</a> has had Twitter in the number 1 spot. &nbsp;And any number of "learning technology" people will tell you it's their most important tool.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing something, but I just don't get it.</p><br>
<p>Twitter is a micro-sharing website - which means I can share a statement containing a maximum of 140 characters. That statement can contain links to other sites, plain words, links to other people (known as @mentions) and links to topics (known as hash tags or #tags).</p><br>
<p>Topics are created organically. A group of people agrees to use a particular #tag and then make sure each of their posts contain that tag.</p><br>
<p>Users can "follow" other people and see everything they're posting, or they can follow particular #tags. They can use either the Twitter website to do this, or any number of desktop or mobile applications - many of which allow you to be quite sophisticated in how you organise what you follow. (eg. <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">Tweetdeck</a>).</p><br>
<p>Twitter users have developed a number of abbreviations, which have now become adopted into the way the system works. For example, RT means ReTweet - ie. you are taking someone's post and pushing it out to the people that follow you.</p><br>
<p>The two characteristics of Twitter are:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>Posts can only be 140 characters long</li><br>
<li>Posts appear as a stream. If you're not watching at the time a post appears, you'll probably miss it unless it gets retweeted later.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>To my mind, Twitter is great for those quick "around the watercooler" conversations. Those ones that happen by chance, when you're in the same time and place as someone else (although with Twitter it relies on one person initially posting something that <em>might </em>be of interest to their followers - they've got no idea of who might be listening at the time - so it's a slightly different situation to a face-to-face conversation).</p><br>
<p>It's also great for pre-planned conversations, that are fixed to a particular time, and usually led by someone who asks a short series of questions. These questions often stimulate further discussion.</p><br>
<p>As a learning tool, Twitter does have some uses. But it has some serious disadvantages too:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>conversations can get very frustrating due to the 140 character limit. Many's the time when I've given up on a debate just because I couldn't say what I needed to in the space available.</li><br>
<li>it's a synchronous tool. If I'm not on Twitter at the right time I will miss what's being said. This has the side-effect of making Twitter (like Facebook) a highly addictive activity.</li><br>
<li>finding a Tweet (a Twitter post) at a later date is nigh on impossible. Google doesn't help - because Tweets are so ephemeral, and no-one links to them, they are rarely, if ever, picked up by the Google search algorithm.</li><br>

<h3>The Alternative?</h3><br>
<p>I learn from the people around me, whether in the office, or from my wider network around the world. They are my personal subject matter experts. It's important to me that I keep up-to-date with thinking in my field (whatever that might be today!)</p><br>
<p>But I don't have the time or inclination to keep an eye out on Twitter for posts from each particular person. And, with each post being so short, they don't usually contain enough meat for me to get a real idea for what that person is trying to say.</p><br>
<p>So, my professional network takes two forms:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>People who think through what they're trying to say and present those thoughts through a piece of work that's taken some effort to produce. It might be a few paragraphs in a blog, or a video, or an infographic. The key thing is that those works sit in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS Reader</a> until such a time as I'm ready to use them. At which point I can mark them as read, tag them for filing, make notes on them, or send them to an email address.</li><br>
<li>People who I'm connected with on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. Then, if I need to find someone to answer a question, I've usually got a very good idea of who is the best person. Unlike Twitter, which gives you very little space to tell anything about who you are.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>Now, there may be people that have got to this article through the auto-tweet that my blog makes. That's great. I'm really pleased you happened to be using Twitter at the same time as the auto-tweet came through. But, if you were away from Twitter and didn't have any other means of being notified about the article, then you would have missed it.</p><br>
<p>When I started blogging, in pre-Twitter days, there wasn't a place to quickly share odd links to stuff, so I put them on my blog. Gradually though, these were replaced by longer articles like this one - far more useful to me (as they help me to crystallise my own thinking), and, I hope, far more useful to the few people that followed the blog.</p><br>
<p>With the wholesale move of learning professionals to Twitter, I think we've lost out a lot of the practice of learning - which is about research, analysis, synthesis and depth of conversation - stuff that you just can't do in 140 characters.</p><br>
<p>I'm still part of the froth and bubble that is Twitter - it provides a useful insight into what people are thinking about at that particular moment in time, and is an easy place to share links to things that might be of interest to others. But to name it my number one learning tool? No. I don't think so.</p></div><h1>Review: NP Training Works</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 August 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.nptrainingworks.com/"><img src="./assets/NP_Training_Works.png" alt="NP Training Works logo" width="350" height="114"></a></div><br>
<p><a href="http://www.nptrainingworks.com/">NP Training Works</a> are a relatively small, US-based company who have developed an elearning content delivery business model that's quite different from the mainstream.</p><br>
<p>They are aiming at small companies and non-profit-making organisations, who don't have the budget to create content for themselves.</p><br>
<p>You're given the option to either buy into their existing library of content (delivered through a branded NP Training Works LMS), or to become a content expert. It's this latter model that's of most interest to me. The content expert provides the subject matter knowledge, NP Training Works provides the development expertise and the marketing know-how (for free), and the content expert receives a royalty payment whenever the content is used.</p><br>
<p>It looks to me like a very low-risk way for small companies to explore the potential of online content delivery, and get their message more widely known. NP Training Works is taking on much of the upfront risk, but mitigates that by being in control of the marketing of the content, which gets added to their content library - for use by their wider network.</p><br>
<p>It's the content library where they need to do most work, but this is probably on the back-burner until the number of available titles increases. Currently learners just browse a straightforward heirarchical catalog, but, if you really want to market well online you need to think about:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>putting your products in multiple categories</li><br>
<li>intelligent algorithms that base recommendations on user activity</li><br>
<li>providing ways for users to rate and comment on products</li><br>
<li>allowing users to sort search results by criteria such as price, ratings, relevance etc</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>In other words, a combination of an ecommerce engine with an LMS delivery engine. If they get this right, they'll have a very powerful system indeed. I don't yet know of any LMS that has really cracked this concept of how to market the content they contain. For some reason, providers still seem to think that learners will use their content because they have to...</p></div><h1>Elearning learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 August 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>You may have noticed the little badge on the right of this blog that says I'm one of <a href="http://www.elearninglearning.com/">elearninglearning.com</a>'s featured writers.</p><br>

<br>
From my perspective, inside a large organisation that delivers a full range of learning &amp; development services, this IT Toolkit isn't just about delivery tools (such as elearning, social learning etc). It must also include the back-office tools that help such services run smoothly and cost effectively.<br>
<br>
During the workshop I identifed five requirements for the IT toolkit, and then three key questions that may help your decision-making. This post is about the five requirements. The key questions will be discussed in a subsequent post.<br>
<br>
I tried to avoid speaking about specific IT systems or applications, except where they were useful as examples. The decision on which is the best application for your organisation must rest on a range of factors that include your specific business requirements, cost, existing systems etc.<br>
<br>
<h3>Requirements</h3><br>
<br>
The requirements identified were:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Maintain effective customer and supplier relationships</li><br>
<li>Forecast and monitor revenue and costs</li><br>
<li>Manage face-to-face and online delivery of formal events</li><br>
<li>Provide learners with access to up-to-date resources</li><br>
<li>Support informal learning</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Of course, there is some overlap between them, but hopefully they provide a good framework on which to build some understanding of what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
<h4>Maintain effective customer and supplier relationships</h4><br>
<br>
Any organisation, or team, that is providing a service to others, and using suppliers, needs to know whether you and your suppliers are meeting the needs of your "customers".<br>
<br>
For very small teams with a limited customer and supplier-base, this may just be through conversations.<br>
<br>
But, as your team grows, or your customers or suppliers become more diverse, so will your need grow for some sort of system that can help track and share knowledge about the people you're working with.<br>
<br>
You'll need something that can help you answer questions like:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>How do you know what each individual customer needs?</li><br>
<li>How do you know what conversations your team has had with each customer?</li><br>
<li>How do you know how well you’re meeting that need?</li><br>
<li>How do you know which of your suppliers is offering best value?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Often, you'll then start to think about putting in place a Customer Relationship Management system - perhaps a generic one like <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/">SugarCRM</a>, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/default.aspx">Microsoft Dynamics</a>, or one that is more specific to learning and development, like <a href="http://www.irisnfp.co.uk/products/iris-coursebooker.aspx">CourseBooker</a>. The choice is huge.<br>
<br>
This would probably happen alongside some means of collecting information from your customers, often through a survey tool. You'll need to aggregate data about what they are looking for, as well as how well you're providing your service.<br>
<br>
There are clever ways of doing this, if you have access to the raw data... In the case of Google [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ-bMbynst0&amp;feature=player_embedded">See this video of the ALT Conference presentation by Sudhir Giri</a>], they ran a full-blown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_needs_analysis">Training Needs Analysis</a>, using surveys, interviews etc, but they also analysed the terms that employees were searching for on the intranet. Comparing the two sets of results showed that an analysis of the search terms was as effective in highlighting training needs as the full TNA.<br>
<br>
Yet, how many L&amp;D teams have any visibility of what people are looking for on their intranet?<br>
<br>
<h4>Forecast and monitor revenue and costs</h4><br>
<br>
Whether you run an internal training team that works with annual budgets, or you run a team that charges for its products and services, you will need to know what's happening with the money. You'll need to know what has happened, and have a very good idea of what is going to happen. You'll also need to know whether the money you are paying out is giving good value.<br>
<br>
Any good customer relationship management system will allow you to keep track of future opportunities. As they become more likely to happen so the forecast revenue and costs will become more certain. This is known as the sales pipeline, and is an important part of any financial management process.<br>
<br>
As you deliver your products and services, you'll need to ensure that you pay your bills on time and also that you retrieve any money owing to you. If you're part of a larger organisation, this should be managed through its financial systems. If not, then using a tool like <a href="http://www.kashflow.com/">Kashflow</a> (many others are available) can make these processes a whole lot simpler.<br>
<br>
<h4>Manage face-to-face and online delivery of formal events</h4><br>
<br>
For most L&amp;D professionals, we're now getting into the interesting bits. But don't forget the back-office systems. They'll provide the foundation needed to make sure your team can be really effective in the services you provide.<br>
<br>
However much we promote the idea of informal learning, there will always be a need for formal interventions where access to resources (whether real or virtual) needs to be managed, either for reasons of security or limited availability. As an aside, I've never understood why some people use pay grade or role as a reason to limit access to online materials!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, we'll still need to schedule access to limited resources, such as classrooms and experts, and plan where those resources will be. We'll need to send out "joining instructions" to learners, and send out reminders as events become imminent.<br>
<br>
And, apart from the management of access, you also may want to support your delivery with IT tools, such as virtual meeting systems, interactive whiteboards, communication &amp; collaboration software or voting systems.<br>
<br>
There are dozens, if not hundreds, of companies competing for your business in this area - often selling tools known as Learning Management Systems.<br>
<br>
You might want to go for a system that can do everything - including the whole talent management piece, such as those provided by the market leaders: <a href="http://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/">Cornerstone</a>, <a href="http://www.saba.com/">Saba</a>, <a href="http://www.taleo.com/">Taleo</a> etc.<br>
<br>
Or you may want to go for a cheaper option that focusses just on the specific aspects you need, eg. <a href="http://www.irisnfp.co.uk/products/iris-coursebooker.aspx">CourseBooker</a>, <a href="http://www.enterprisestudy.com/">Enterprise Study</a>, <a href="http://www.netdimensions.com/products/lms.php">Net Dimensions EKP</a> etc (There are huge numbers available. Please don't take a mention here as being a recommendation!). But try to think ahead as to how your needs may develop. You'll need to be certain your supplier is going in a similar direction to you.<br>
<br>
Many organisations are turning to the open-source world to meet their needs. <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is the obvious answer here. It's a great application, which I've used since version 1.0. But it's important to remember that Moodle is designed explicitly to support delivery of tutor-led interventions, in conjunction with a student record system that handles all the administration and resource management.<br>
<br>
A number of organisations have developed add-ons for Moodle that attempt to provide the requisite administration functions, eg. (<a href="http://www.totaralms.com/">Kineo - with Totara</a>, <a href="http://www.aardpress.com/moomis.php">Moomis</a>, <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Face-to-face_module">Face to face module</a>) . Or you may want to look at adapting one of the existing open-source student record systems for your purposes, although most are based around the needs of schools rather than companies.<br>
<br>
On the virtual meeting room front there are a number of strong contenders. You could try <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, although this tends to get blocked by a number of organisations, and does require a significant download.<br>
<br>
If you want to avoid anyone having to install software, then use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html">Adobe Connect</a>. This does assume that everyone has Flash installed on their system already.<br>
<br>
Other tools include <a href="http://www.webex.co.uk/">Webex</a>, <a href="http://cloud.saba.com/">Saba Centra</a> and <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx">Blackboard Collaborate (Elluminate)</a>. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but can all be used to run effective online meetings and seminars.<br>
<br>
In the open-source world, we also have <a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a>, which is steadily catching up with the front-runners.<br>
<br>
<h4>Provide learners with access to up-to-date resources</h4><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/coverflow.jpg"><img alt="Coverflow interface" src="./assets/coverflow.jpg" width="517" height="408"></a><br>
iPod Coverflow Interfaces are a great way of finding content. Image credit: <a href="http://www.classycode.co.uk/CoverFlow/">http://www.classycode.co.uk/CoverFlow/</a> </div><br>
<br>
Those people who have already learnt how to learn will be constantly on the lookout for trusted sources that can support their particular learning needs.<br>
<br>
If they can't find what they need, they'll go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
So, the systems you put in place to deliver content need to be as easy to use, and as smart, as the systems your learners use in their everyday use. You will be compared with the likes of Amazon, BBC, Youtube, Slideshare etc. If the content you're providing is available more easily somewhere else, you will find your learners leaving you.<br>
<br>
Please note, that, in my opinion, there is no difference between learning content and information content. Too often we put information content in our intranets, and hide learning content inside our learning management systems, with no connection between the two. <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/01/28/getting-more-from-your-lms?blog=5">As I've said before</a>, I believe only assessments should be placed inside the LMS<br>
<br>
You will need to consider the typical behaviours of a modern learner when accessing content:<br>
<br>
They'll want to be able to get to it on their mobile device, as well as at their desk.<br>
<br>
If it's text or contains complex graphics, they'll probably want to print it out at some point.<br>
<br>
They'll want to be able to post a link to your resource in an email, an instant message or in your internal communication systems, and expect that recipients will be able to get to it without a lot of additional navigation.<br>
<br>
They'll want to be able to make comments against the resource; asking questions of the author, adding additional ideas, or simply reviewing it.<br>
<br>
They'll want to rate it or tag it - partly so they can find it more easily again, and partly to make it easier for their colleagues to filter out the good from the bad.<br>
<br>
They'll want to be notified by email or RSS when new resources are published - ideally ones that fit a particular category or search term.<br>
<br>
They may even want to add their own resource, for use by their colleagues. Although you might want to identify "official" resources in some way...<br>
<br>
When considering content delivery, you will need to think about how you intend to create your content, publish it, and then deliver it.<br>
<br>
Companies such as <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/">Xyleme</a> and <a href="http://www.exact-learning.com/">Exact Learning</a> (formerly Giunti Labs) provide ways to create your content once and then publish it in multiple ways. That may be appropriate for you, or you may decide that all your content will use a particular format, and stick with that. Be aware though that you run the risk of seeing every problem as a nail if you only have a hammer. This is particularly true of people who have bought into elearning content development tools like <a href="http://www.articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html">Captivate</a>, <a href="http://www.kaplanlt.com/al.aspx">Atlantic Link</a> etc. They then become the default way of producing resources, regardless of whether that is the best mechanism. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, I would always start with the learner, and consider the best delivery system to meet their requirements. But think about that alongside the types of content that I would expect to be providing for them. There is a new breed of tools out there now, including <a href="http://www.fusion-universal.com/products_services/fusion-social-learning.php">Fusion social learning</a> and <a href="http://www.wisetail.com/">Wisetail's Learning Ecosystem</a>, that take the best functionality people use on the wider web, and make it available to more closed groups and organisations.<br>
<br>
<h4>Support informal learning</h4><br>
<br>
Informal learning is driven by need and by recommendation. To support informal learning effectively you will need to consider both drivers.<br>
<br>
When learners need to know something, they will take one of two routes. They'll go to a search engine, or they will ask someone. The actual route taken will depend on the learner's perception of which one will offer the best answer the most quickly.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/search.png"><img alt="Search box" src="./assets/search.png" width="500" height="87"></a></div><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/feed.png"><img alt="Microblog post" src="./assets/feed.png" width="500" height="125"></a></div><br>
<br>
As a minimum, your systems should include a good search engine - ideally one that can search any text inside your content, and not just the metadata [link] about that content. It's not enough to say that a particular elearning module contains the information they need. They'll need to be able to get to that information quickly - not by trawling through until they reach page 33 of 45!<br>
<br>
The more forward-looking organisations are beginning to also implement social communication tools that are built around the concept of interlinked networks. These are fantastic at allowing ideas to filter across even the most siloed organisation. [See <a href="http://blog.yammer.com/blog/2010/06/deloitte-uses-yammer-to-drive-innovation.html">the Deloitte case study on using Yammer</a>].<br>
<br>
Networks do take work to maintain - both by the individual and by the organisation (which needs to provide central resource to help the network to develop). But their value in facilitating innovation and reducing duplication of effort is huge.<br>
<br>
The risk to organisations of not providing internal networking tools is that your employees will end up more connected with people outside of your organisation then with those inside.</div><h1>Key technology questions to ask</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 20 September 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>In a <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/09/20/it-toolkit-for-a-learning-1?blog=5">recent post</a>, I discussed the five requirements a learning organisation may need to address when considering IT systems.<br>
<br>
Over-arching these requirements are three key questions that need to be answered when putting in any IT system:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Single or multi-user?</li><br>
<li>Internal or external hosting?</li><br>
<li>Multi-function or best of breed?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
These questions apply almost regardless of the function of the system - whether it's content development, learning delivery, project management, customer relationship management or finance.<br>
<br>

Some examples of companies towards the Open Selling end of the spectrum:<br>

<br>
I'll spare the blushes of the rest of the industry that seems to think the web exists only to provide a sanitised shop window. What they don't seem to realise is that people will talk to each other anyway, and information about their product will get into the hands of competitors regardless. But they'll be excluded from those conversations.<br>
<br>
The benefit of the open approach, is that you will end up with a far more joined up message, as your marketing, pre-sales and customer support personnel can all use the same materials, and will all be having the conversations with the market.<br>
<br>
Read the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> if you want more on this.<br>
<br>
I would welcome any comments from suppliers who adopt the closed approach, because I'm struggling to see what the benefits are.</div><h1>The Mobile LMS</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 27 September 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Looking around the LMS marketplace, there are lots of providers who will let you get to elearning content on your mobile device.<br>
<br>
But I'm looking for something more like the Amazon or Ebay apps, which let you interact with the application.<br>
<br>
For example, on a mobile device I would like to be able to:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Search for potential learning interventions (whether courses, reference content, or experts) by topic, title, location, date etc</li><br>
  <li><br>
Read reviews of those interventions<br>

  <li>Mark interventions as of possible future interest</li><br>
<br>
  <li>Book onto a face-to-face event</li><br>
<br>
  <li>Read content</li><br>
<br>
  <li>View videos</li><br>
<br>
  <li>Evaluate the intervention - using ratings and reviews</li><br>
<br>
  <li>Recommend the intervention to my learning network that's linked to the LMS</li><br>
<br>
  <li>Ask questions of my learning network</li><br>

Does anyone know of an LMS provider that understands how people use mobile devices?</div><h1>A beginner's guide to using the internet safely</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>What advice around internet safety would you give to someone who is relatively new to using the internet, or social media in particular? Here's my starter for nine, followed by a link to some official advice:<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li><strong>People aren't always who they say they are.</strong> That applies to websites too. Always make sure you get a second opinion from someone you trust.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Your emails are your soft underbelly.</strong> If someone can get to your emails, they can change your password on most of the systems you'll be using. Your email password should be the strongest one you have.</li><br>
  <li><strong>You are what you write.</strong> If you're posting on social media sites, writing comments on blogs, discussing things in forums etc, you'll build up a reputation that's based entirely on those. How do you want people to view you and the organisations you're associated with?</li><br>
  <li><strong>Assume that nothing can be deleted.</strong> As soon as you write something, assume that it's there forever. The website owner might retain a copy, Google will retain a copy, and the Internet Archive will probably retain a copy. If it was on Twitter, it will be stored forever by the <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2010/04/how-tweet-it-is-library-acquires-entire-twitter-archive/">Library of Congress</a>.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Assume that nothing is private.</strong> Don't write down anything that might upset your children, your parents or employer. It might (and probably will) come back to haunt you. If you're not sure whether to publish, then ask someone!</li><br>
  <li><strong>Your browser is your gateway and gatekeeper.</strong> Your internet browser (whether Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox etc) is the way to get to a huge range of resources. If you keep your browser up-to-date, it can also act as a very effective gatekeeper - keeping you away from sites that are trying to grab your personal details, or take over your computer.</li><br>
  <li><strong>The risks change frequently.</strong> Make sure your firewall and anti-virus software is kept up-to-date. If you don't know what these are, then get advice and follow it.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Backups help you sleep at night.</strong> What would you do it you computer got destroyed or stolen, or even simply broke down? Is there anything on it that would be difficult to replace? If yes, then make sure you know that there's a second copy somewhere else - preferably made automatically, so you don't have to worry about it. But make sure you can get to that copy when you need it too!</li><br>
  <li><strong>Check everything before you report it as fact.</strong> The internet is full of hoaxes and misinformation. They are usually quite easy to check out before passing on. Just put some of the key terms into a search engine to see if any of the hoax tracking sites know of it.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
I would strong recommend the <a href="https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/Parents/InternetSafety/">Internet Safety pages</a> put up by CEOP. And they're not just for children!</div><h1>Cloud systems - security questions</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Both <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/10/7-reasons-to-put-heads-in-cloud-based-e.html">Donald Clark</a> and <a href="http://kategraham23.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/exploring-live-online-learning-and-cloud-technologies/">Kate Graham</a> have recently identified some resistance to moving towards cloud-based software.<br>
<br>
The advantages, as outlined by Donald, are compelling, but there's a huge question around security.<br>
<br>
When you put software inside your firewall, you take responsibility for its security and the data stored within it.<br>
<br>
How do you know that the cloud-software companies work to the same standards as you?<br>
<br>
The good news is that most of them will probably have higher standards. For example, is it better to store personal data about school-children in a server cupboard inside a school building, or in a purpose-built data centre, with multi-layered physical and logical security and redundant systems?<br>
<br>
The bad news is that you are still the responsible party. You will have to undertake enough due diligence on your suppliers to be able to show that you'd done everything you could to protect your data and your organisation's reputation. It's your job on the line, not the software provider's.<br>
<br>
Some software companies are extremely helpful in this respect. They publish full descriptions of how they address security concerns, at a software level, at server level, at network level and at datacentre level.<br>
<br>
Salesforce is a particularly good example of this practice. Their site at http://trust.salesforce.com/trust/security/ provides detailed information under a number of key headings. I've adapted these below and suggested what cloud software providers should describe at a bare minimum:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Data centre</li><br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Where are the data centres located? (This is particularly true if you are in the UK and subject to the Data Protection Act)</li><br>
  <li>How do you control access to the data centre and prevent physical attacks</li><br>
  <li>How do you control the environmental around the servers - temperature and humidity in particular?</li><br>
  <li>How do you ensure that power is maintained to the facility, even when the power network is down?</li><br>
  <li>How do you ensure that high bandwidth internet connections can be maintained?</li><br>
  <li>How do you detect and suppress fire?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
  <li>How do you ensure that network traffic is encrypted securely and is from known users?</li><br>
  <li>What layers of protection are in place for your network, eg. firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus?</li><br>
  <li>What do you do to ensure that service is maintained even when a data centre or a server goes offline?</li><br>
  <li>How do you ensure that data can be recovered even if all your systems go down?</li><br>
  <li>What do you do to make sure your code isn't vulnerable to attack? (See the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-Main">OWASP list of top 10 vulnerabilities</a>)?</li><br>
  <li>How do test your systems?</li><br>
  <li>How do you monitor your systems?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Now, it may be that you're a small business or organisation, and the risk to you of losing some of your data is outweighed by the cost of dealing with an organisation that has all these systems in place.<br>
<br>
But, I would argue, that, as soon as you enter confidential or personal information onto a system, you need to start thinking about these questions - regardless of how big you are.<br>
<br>
This will probably be difficult for the smaller hosting providers, who have created a market in hosting open-source software like Moodle and SugarCRM. But they still need to consider the questions and have sensible answers about the level of risk that they are putting you under.<br>
<br>
Any provider of cloud-software that doesn't explicitly address security somewhere on their website needs to think again. And anyone who is procuring such services needs to consider carefully the level of risk they are prepared to accept.<br>
<br>
Other examples of security statements include:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/Monkey_Security.aspx">SurveyMonkey</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/security/">SurveyGizmo</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.kashflow.com/security.asp">Kashflow</a></li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
As you'll see, they have different amounts of information available - but at least they've addressed the questions - showing that they understand the issue.<br>
<br>
[Update: Of course, if your internal IT people are hosting software that is accessible on the internet, like cloud software, then you'll need to ask them the same questions...]</div><h1>Is your home network safe?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Many of us work from home and use the internet on a daily basis. Just as in a city, the internet has some places that are good to be, and others that are not so good. The difference though is that, on the internet, you can be sent to one of those dodgy places from a single click.<br>
<br>
To protect you, your family and your work colleagues, I would advise a simple strategy that works just like a castle, with multi-layers of defence.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/300px-Beaumaris_Castle.jpg"><img alt="Beaumaris Castle" src="./assets/300px-Beaumaris_Castle.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><br>
Beaumaris Castle - from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumaris_Castle">Wikipedia/Beaumaris Castle</a></div><br>
<br>
<h3>Layer 1: Incoming traffic</h3><br>
<br>
Usually, all the internet traffic that comes into your house will be coming through a single connection into your router. The router maintains the link to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Most ISP's operate as a transparent gateway onto the internet. So, what you need to do, is redirect your internet traffic so that it comes through a more secure route that you can control.<br>
<br>
The simplest way to do this is to use a service like <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">www.opendns.com</a>. With a single change to your router setup, all internet traffic will go through the OpenDNS servers which maintain lists of any sites that are dodgy. You can even extend this filtering to block other types of unwanted sites.<br>
<br>
OpenDNS is free to home users, so there's really no excuse not to make the change. Having said that, some of the basic routers that come from ISP's (eg. O2) don't make it particularly easy to change their setup. You may need to do a bit of digging on the OpenDNS forums, but you can be sure that someone will have done it already.<br>
<br>
Once your traffic is routed via OpenDNS, then anyone using your network, whether cabled or through WiFi, will be subject to whatever filtering you've switched on, and will be protected from vast numbers of sites that are just looking to damage your equipment or your bank account.<br>
<br>
<h3>Layer 2: Inbound email</h3><br>
<br>
Make sure your email provider has methods of blocking spam (junk mail) and mail containing viruses. It makes life so much easier if they can do it for you. I use Google's gmail system, which is extremely efficient at both jobs, and rarely filters out messages wrongly.<br>
<br>
<h3>Layer 3: Your PC</h3><br>
<br>
If you're working on company-supplied computers, you often won't have any control over what systems are running on it. But it's still worth being aware of how to minimise the risks, when you use your own equipment.<br>
<br>
Most modern computer systems, whether with Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, are at risk in some way from attacks and viruses. Your router will provide some protection, but the next stage is with the operating system itself. The actual risk varies depending on the operating system you're using. Windows is under most attack, but that doesn't mean Mac &amp; Linux users are free from risk - it's just lower.<br>
<br>
For maximum protection, it's worth spending money on one or two additional pieces of software - a firewall and an anti-virus system. Sometimes they come combined in the one application. There are also free tools, which are very good but perhaps without the support or service you'd get from a paid-for version.<br>
<br>
A firewall does what it says; it stops traffic getting into your computer that might cause damage. Usually you're given the option to let certain things through if you know what they are. I still find it surprising to see how many potential attacks are thwarted by firewalls. It's because attackers are constantly using automated tools to find and exploit weaknesses.<br>
<br>
An anti-virus tool prevents you downloading or opening files that might contain potentially malicious code. Usually they'll also try to "clean up" any infected files.<br>
<br>
<h3>Layer 4: Your browser</h3><br>
<br>
Your browser is your window on the internet, and, as such, is the last layer of defence against sites that are out to cause problems.<br>
<br>
Many of the major browsers will warn you if you end up on a web site that is known to contain malicious code. But this is only true if you keep your browser up-to-date. If you're still running Internet Explorer 6 or older (which, even now, is still quite likely if you're using a machine supplied by your employer) then you are running a very large risk every time you use the internet. It's no wonder that these organisations often make Layer 1 so secure/impenetrable as to make it almost impossible to use the internet usefully.<br>
<br>
Often, the older browsers are kept for good reasons - as the organisation's software may only run on that particular browser version. My advice would be (if you are allowed) to use Google Chrome or Firefox as your main browser for internet use, and keep IE just for using corporate systems.</div><h1>Channel shift in your local school</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>You'd think the following would be priorities for a school:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Saving paper and printing costs</li><br>
  <li>Ensuring that parents and students are able to find out information about school activities quickly and easily</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Yet my local school at least, still relies of vast quantities of printed letters, sent home by pupil post, and often quickly lost in the piles of paper that tend to accumulate.<br>
<br>
There is a better way.<br>
<br>
Imagine a school where only private correspondence gets printed by default. Where parents have to opt-in to receiving letters by pupil post.<br>
<br>
Instead, letters are uploaded as PDF's to the website.<br>
<br>
But, wait, how will anyone know that something new has been added?<br>
<br>
That's the easy bit... If you use software like <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to drive the website, it comes with a simple piece of technology called "Really Simple Syndication" (RSS). You can very easily use this to make sure that anything new gets sent to immediately and automatically to Facebook, Twitter, and people who subscribe by email.<br>
<br>
It's similar to the <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/02/27/network-publishing?blog=5">network publishing approach</a> I use:<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/network_publishing.001(1).png"><img alt="Network publishing" src="./assets/network_publishing.001(1).png" width="400" height="300"></a></div><br>
<br>
There are lots of ways to organise stuff inside Wordpress. You could have separate sub-sites for each year group, each with their own design. Or you could organise posts by categories (which makes it easy to attach posts to multiple year groups). Each category can have its own separate RSS feed, so people are only fed the content they want to see.<br>
<br>
Once the letters and notices are on the site, they then become a valuable resource for when a vital piece of information is forgotten. There's always a central source of information that parents and students know they can get to.<br>
<br>
In the corporate world, this is known as "<a href="http://www.publicnet.co.uk/news/2010/11/26/digital-champion-calls-for-channel-shift-in-public-services/">channel shift</a>" (link is to a Publicnet.co.uk report). It takes time and effort to make work, and there will be people who will resist the change - some for good reasons.<br>
<br>
What you're trying to do is make your communication methods more efficient, by reducing the spend on the input, and increasing the value of the output.<br>
<br>
When the majority of your parents and students see the value of engaging with you online, and lose the expectation of receiving paper letters every week, then you'll have achieved channel shift.<br>
<br>
Of course, the ultimate in channel shifting a school would be to make better use of the digital space for teaching and learning. I alluded to this in my post last year about <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/12/07/6-reasons-not-to-maintain-a-school-service-during-closure-days?blog=5">snow days</a>. Channel shifting away from the need to be in a certain place at a certain time would greatly improve the efficiency of schools, and increase their resilience during times when the school building is not able to be used.</div><h1>What would your Senior Management say to this?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 11 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you were able to put this in front of your senior management team, how do you think they would react?<br>

<br>
Yet, at the same time, there are providers (eg. <a href="http://www.sonar6.com/">Sonar6</a>) who are providing specialist, niche products within this space.<br>
<br>
So, which is the right direction? Should you go for a one-supplier solution, or opt for a combination of best-of-breed solutions?<br>
<br>
I can't give you the answer, but I can take you through some of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. Over time, you'll probably end up with a combination of both. That's fine, as long as you go into it with your eyes open.<br>
<br>
<h3>Integrated system</h3><br>
<br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
<li>One supplier to deal with</li><br>
<li>A unified interface, with consistent operation&nbsp;across the whole application&nbsp;(that's the ideal!)</li><br>
<li>Data flows between system modules are seamless. Modules use each other's data such that users don't realise they are using separate modules.</li><br>
<li>Simple to implement, with no systems integration work to do (again, that's the ideal</li><br>
<li>Often robust implementation programmes</li><br>
<li>Often sophisticated and well-documented security processes and practices</li><br>
<li>Understand the enterprise market and how to deal with large organisations</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Many suppliers have bought in other systems to fill gaps. You'll need to check how well integrated these are, in terms of user interface and data flows between modules. For example, if each module has its own search function, then the system is not integrated!</li><br>
<li>Can be cumbersome and complex to use and to understand</li><br>
<li>Difficult for the supplier to keep up with the best-of-breed offerings</li><br>
<li>You will still find gaps in the offering</li><br>
<li>Implementation will often require large change management and training programmes</li><br>
<li>Moving to a new supplier may be very complex and painful</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>Best-of-breed systems</h3><br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Agile - able to respond to changes in the market very rapidly</li><br>
<li>Specialist - you'll be buying into their specific knowledge of this specific function</li><br>
<li>Each building block can be rolled out separately, without affecting the other systems</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Multiplicity of interfaces can become confusing, especially when there is duplication of functionality</li><br>
<li>Can become complex to integrate, particularly when there is duplication of functionality across multiple systems</li><br>

</ul></div><h1>Moodle in the corporate sector</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 20 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, and have been since it was first released. At the time, I was working as a consultant, going into schools and supporting their implementation of a particular “learning platform”. When Moodle was released it became increasingly difficult to highlight the benefits of the software I was advocating – when I knew there was a far better alternative...<br>
<br>
Moodle offered many advantages to schools:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Low cost of entry – it was easy and cheap to try it out</li><br>
  <li>Simple, consistent interface, with workflows built around the needs of the teacher</li><br>
  <li>Highly flexible course design, with the ability to mix and match many different types of resources (files of all types) and activities (where the student has to do something, eg. forums, wikis, quizzes etc)</li><br>
  <li>Well thought out philosophy of learning</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Over time, Moodle’s foothold in the formal education sector has increased massively. Alongside that, many organisations in the corporate sector have begun to use it as the system of choice. The advantages for this sector are similar in many ways to schools and colleges:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Tried and tested technology – with many examples of high volume Moodle sites</li><br>
  <li>No license fees - so easy to pilot and to scale up (not forgetting that scaling up will need significant investment in technology, integration services and support)</li><br>
  <li>Robust and secure software underpinned by rigorous development processes (of the core code)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
However, very few corporate users of Moodle are making use of its most powerful features, which are designed to support tutors and teachers as they work with students.<br>
<br>
Instead, they are using a very small subset of the available functionality, and trying to lever a system designed for formal, teacher-supported education into the self-service corporate learning &amp; development environment. This raises some significant problems:<br>
<br>
<h3>Content delivery</h3><br>
<br>
Most corporate L&amp;D departments simply focus on delivering content (usually <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5">SCORM</a> packages). This is a shame, because they’re missing out on some great tools, but it also means that users have to get to grips with the course interfaces, just to access content.<br>
<br>
It starts with the course container, into which all resources and activities are placed. That’s fine if you want to build a “curriculum” or “course” with multiple things for the learner to access. But most organisations just want to deliver single SCORM packages. The best LMS’s make it really easy for learners to quickly get to where they need by providing links on their home page, or even automatically emailing deep links to them. That’s only possible with Moodle if you create some extra code to expose those links on the home page.<br>
<br>
<h3>Student record system</h3><br>
<br>
Moodle is designed to work alongside a student record system which makes sure the right students have access to the right courses, with the right permissions and in the right groups.<br>
<br>
If you don’t have access to such a system with that sort of data, then you’ll need to create one or build processes (eg. with Excel) that mirror its functionality. The alternative is to use the powerful self-service registration and enrolment functions built into Moodle, but that often means relinquishing some control, with an associated increase in risk.<br>
<br>
<h3>Face-to-face events</h3><br>
<br>
There is a <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Face-to-face_module">face-to-face events module</a> that can be added to Moodle, but this is really designed to manage events within the course paradigm. There is no concept of the course being the event itself.<br>
<br>
So, if you’re going to need some way of managing many events across different courses, along with joining instructions and trainers’ diaries, then you’ll need something else in addition to Moodle.<br>
<br>
<h3>Site-wide reporting</h3><br>
<br>
Most of the reporting available within Moodle is designed to help teachers manage their individual courses. There is little out-of-the-box functionality to help L&amp;D administrators understand how much usage the courses and their resources/activities are getting across all the users.<br>
<br>
It’s possible to build additional reports, but it’s all at a cost.<br>
<br>
<h3>Hierarchical relationships</h3><br>
<br>
Within Moodle there is no concept of a manager who looks after a team of people and needs to see their activity across a number of different courses.<br>
<br>
In fact there is no hierarchy at all. There are different roles within courses, or within the whole site, but no way to model a management structure.<br>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3><br>
<br>
As I said, I think Moodle’s a great product ... in the right context.<br>
<br>
If you’re going to use it within a corporate environment you really need to go into it with your eyes open, and understand how you are going to work within the limitations of the software.<br>
<br>
It may mean some compromises in how you and your learners use Moodle, or it may mean investing in additional code to make it do what you want. (That’s exactly what <a href="http://www.kineo.com/">Kineo</a> have done with their <a href="http://www.totaralms.com/">Totara</a> version of Moodle, which has a number of corporate-focussed functions added, although there's less focus on the face-to-face element than many of the high-end learning management systems, like <a href="http://www.saba.com/">Saba</a> and <a href="http://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/">Cornerstone</a>, offer)</div><h1>Starting out in online learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I often get people asking me for support as they begin to develop some sort of online learning capability.<br>
<br>
As with all aspects of teaching and learning - it's more an art than a science, but there are a number of key starting points:<br>
<br>
<h3>Know your brain science</h3><br>
<br>
This applies to all forms of teaching, whether online or offline, but it's vital that we build our interventions on what research (not anecdote!) tells us about how the brain works.<br>
<br>
I'd recommend every teacher/tutor/learning designer take a look at <a href="http://www.brainrules.net/the-rules">Brain Rules</a>. You can start with the videos, but to get most value, it's probably better to get the book.<br>
<br>
The most important from our perspective are:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/attention">Rule #4: We don't pay attention to boring things</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/short-term-memory?scene=">Rule #5: Repeat to remember</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/long-term-memory?scene=">Rule #6: Remember to repeat</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/sensory-integration?scene=">Rule #9: Stimulate more of the senses</a></li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/vision?scene=">Rule #10: Vision trumps all other senses</a></li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Don't go too quickly</h3><br>
<br>
The online environment, as a space for formal learning, is new and strange to many people. It has different rules &amp; conventions ( aka <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html">Netiquette</a>). It also is potentially a very isolating space. These factors combined mean that many learners will choose to drop out before you've even begun to get them involved in learning anything.<br>
<br>
If you follow Gilly Salmon's <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">5 stage model</a> for supporting learners, you will be more likely to achieve some form of success. It's designed for Higher Education, but still applies in corporate learning &amp; development. Stage 1 (Access &amp; Motivation), in particular, cannot be ignored - whether you're designed self-study materials, or trying to build a community of practice. If your learners cannot easily get to where you want them to be, or have nothing to motivate them to get there, then you might as well give up now.<br>
<br>
<h3>Consider what you're trying to achieve</h3><br>
<br>
If all you're doing is wanting to make information available, then <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/01/28/getting-more-from-your-lms?blog=5">don't hide it away inside a SCORM elearning package</a>. Put it somewhere where it can be easily found.<br>
<br>
If you're wanting to change behaviours or develop skills, then build your learning design around practise and making mistakes.<br>
<br>
Cathy Moore is the person I turn to for advice on learning design. Her practical <a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2008/05/be-an-elearning-action-hero/">Action Mapping</a> planning process makes far more sense than just focussing on transferring knowledge (which is nigh-on impossible in your time frames anyway (see Brain Rules above).<br>
<br>
And, if you're looking for where this works for real, look at her extensive list of <a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/elearning-samples/">examples</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>Become an expert</h3><br>
<br>
Whatever tools you are using, whether Moodle, Wordpress, Articulate, Captivate, Webex etc - or any combination of them - you need to spend time learning how to get the best out of them.<br>
<br>
Don't be satisfied with how you're doing things - as there's always room for improvement. And there are plenty of people out there sharing their knowledge of what worked for them.<br>
<br>
It's up to you to build your network of trusted advisors, and even begin to share your own learning journey, so other people can learn from your mistakes.<br>
<br>
A few places to start:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/">The Rapid eLearning Blog</a> - written by Tom Kuhlmann from Articulate - but it's not about Articulate per se. What he writes applies to anyone creating self-study learning materials.<br>
<a href="http://onlignment.com/">Onlignment</a> - a collection of UK-based experts in online communication. Get hold of their eBooks. They're free!<br>
<a href="http://internettime.posterous.com/">Internet Time Alliance</a> - an international team of experts in social and informal learning<br>
<a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> - an amazing curator of useful information around learning technologies<br>
<a href="http://www.elearninglearning.com/">Elearning Learning</a> - an actively curated collection of ideas and information from across the online learning world</div><h1>Mobile content delivery</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 28 October 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've been looking at options for creating and delivering content to mobile devices (phones, tablets etc).<br>
<br>
There are a number of possibilities:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>via a website, formatted for mobile viewing</li><br>
  <li>as a downloadable pdf</li><br>
  <li>as an ebook</li><br>
  <li>as a native app</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
There are plus and minus points for each of the options. Here they are as I see them at the moment. I'd welcome any feedback though, as I'm working on limited knowledge here ...<br>
<br>
Much depends on where you're starting from (eg. do you have existing materials you want to push out), what your plans are (eg. will you be wanting to keep these materials up-to-date), and how much you will be deploying (eg. will this be a one-off, or part of a major publishing operation).<br>
<br>
There are products that can help you, if you're going to be deploying lots of content. Eg. <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/product/pastiche">Xyleme's Pastiche</a> (See marketing video below - I'm not linked with the company - but I think they've got the right idea.)<br>
<br>
[youtube]Un1S9xLMh5g[/youtube]<br>
<br>
Or you can use tools like <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to convert and deploy eBooks.<br>
<br>
But don't expect it to be easy if you've got materials already published - particularly if they're only available as PDF's. <br>
<br>
<h3>Via a website</h3><br>
<br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Able to be easily updated</li><br>
  <li>Can be built on a normal content management system (eg. Wordpress)</li><br>

  <li>One central copy of the content that's always up-to-date for all users</li><br>
  <li>Able to use multi-media and collaborative features of the web</li><br>
  <li>Searchable - if a search engine is built into the website</li><br>
<br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Very difficult to make the content available offline</li><br>
  <li>Requires an internet connection to be used</li><br>
  <li>Requires authentication and user management if access needs to be controlled</li><br>
  <li>Styling can become complex if multiple device types require access</li><br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>As a downloadable pdf</h3><br>
<br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Access easily controllable</li><br>

  <li>Does not reformat well for different sized devices</li><br>
  <li>Little ability for users to annotate and bookmark documents</li><br>
  <li>Difficult to embed multimedia</li><br>
  <li>Impossible to update automatically with new versions</li><br>
<br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>As an ebook</h3><br>
<br>
<h4>Advantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Easy to deploy to multiple device platforms</li><br>
  <li>Automatic reformatting to fit different sized devices</li><br>

  <li>Possible to update with new versions</li><br>
  <li>Takes advantages of eBook functionality on the device - eg. Notes, bookmarks, search</li><br>
  <li>Able to control access</li><br>
<br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Requires new production processes to be adopted</li><br>
  <li>Requires designers to use semantic styles (in Word or HTML) rigorously - see <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/04/working-efficiently-word-processing?blog=5">Working Efficiently: Word Processing</a> for why this is a good idea anyway.</li><br>
  <li>Difficult to convert existing materials if they are not already well structured (with semantic tags or styles)<br>
</li></ul><br>
<br>

  <li>Difficult to deploy across multiple platforms</li><br>
</ul></div><h1>Self-driven professional development</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 3 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I'm really pleased to see what's happening amongst the teaching community in the UK and around the world.<br>
<br>
Teachers are starting to take control of their own professional development.<br>
<br>
This is a great step forward for a profession that has been systematically de-professionalised over the past 23 years. Successive government dictats and draconian inspection regimes have forced teachers into standardised practices that allow little room for flexibility and creativity. Thankfully, this now appears to be receding, but, like a wave leaving ripples on a beach, it's left a teaching profession not sure how to pick up the reins.<br>
<br>
Gradually though, this is changing. <br>
<br>
A few years ago, what started with a handful of teachers blogging about their work - reflecting on what went well and what didn't, has now become a powerful movement.<br>
<br>
Closing down the local teacher centres and advisory services did put a stop to many of the face-to-face information sharing sessions that had been organised centrally. But, instead,  teachers are now organising their own gatherings (known as <a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/">TeachMeets</a>), that are focussing on specific topics such as <a href="http://www.oliverquinlan.com/blog/2011/10/28/teachmeet-plymouth-buzzing-about-behaviour/">behaviour</a> and <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/02/25/reflections-on-the-oxford-teachmeet-fishbowl?blog=5">cross-phase planning</a>.<br>
<br>
Teachers have become some of the most proficient users of social media, as shown by the recent report from Pearson Education: <a href="http://pearsoncpl.com/2011/tweeting-for-teachers-how-can-social-media-support-teacher-professional-development/">Tweeting for Teachers</a>.<br>
<br>
They are learning from each other, and being open about their own professional practice. And this learning is having an <a href="http://www.agent4change.net/innovators/580-the-innovators-15-dawn-hallybone.html">impact in the classroom</a>.<br>
<br>
For a long time, I've been hoping that the teacher training institutions would realise the importance of building sustainable professional development practices. It looks like that has started. Certainly it has at <a href="http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.com/2011/11/blogstorm.html">Plymouth University</a>. The newly qualified teachers that leave Plymouth will have an existing professional network, and a really good idea of how to maintain those connections to get the best out of them.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, as these teachers move through the system, we'll start to see the end of the expectation that CPD is someone reading bullet points to you for an hour!<br>
<br>
Effective CPD is about conversations that challenge and support. Those who set themselves up as experts, though, need to realise that they are just one source of those conversations. If they don't play their part in the networks then they will quickly lose their role as a trusted source. People will just say "I don't know you".<br>
<br>
<h3>More information</h3><br>
<br>
For more on the idea of self-directed learning, in the context of work, see Joitske Hulsebosch's post on "<a href="http://joitskehulsebosch.blogspot.com/2011/11/about-serial-mastery-and-social-media.html">Serial Mastery and Social Media</a>"</div><h1>Corporate IT versus SAAS : an unequal contest</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 10 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Corporate IT in many organisations is in a difficult position at the moment; squeezed between its users with ever-increasing expectations, and between shareholders who want even more value for money.<br>
 <br>
And then along come the Software As A Service (SAAS) companies offering to meet user expectations and at a better price.<br>
 <br>
It's just not fair!<br>
 <br>
In this article, I will take a look at how the SAAS providers are able to do so much, so cheaply; why it's almost impossible for internal IT departments to compete on equal terms; and some possible routes forward for corporate IT.<br>
 <br>
SAAS providers put their application onto an Internet-facing server (or, more likely, servers) and make that single application available to multiple clients. This is known as the multi-tenanted model, and is one of the most common form of SAAS operation.<br>
 <br>
What this means is that SAAS software is highly commoditised, you buy as little or as much of it as you want. That's where corporate IT, with their bespoke implementations each time, just cannot compete.<br>
 <br>
By having a single instance of their software, SAAS providers significantly reduce the cost of deployment and maintainance. They only have to do things once. Of course, they have to do it right first time, but that's why most SAAS providers have extremely rigorous testing and deployment procedures to prevent any mistakes. Corporate IT has to do the same thing, but without the size of organisation behind them.<br>
 <br>
With SAAS providers talking about having millions of users, not thousands, like most corporate IT departments, they are able to make use of massive economies of scale. Their server farms will be designed from the ground up to be reliable, and, if a component does fail, there'll be robust systems that kick in to prevent the whole service falling over. It has to be like this; when you've got millions of users globally, you can't afford the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/12/blackberry-server-problems-users">PR disaster</a> that would result from a wholesale system failure. Again, corporate IT should be doing the same thing, but 100% service levels are extremely expensive to achieve.<br>
 <br>
SAAS software has to be easy to use and highly configurable, especially in a competitive marketplace. So SAAS providers generally invest vast sums in creating highly configurable and intuitive user interfaces. They know they are competing in a consumer market; not just for the enterprise spend, but also for the individual. That sort of investment is something you rarely see in corporate software which is usually designed around the needs of the organisation rather than the end user.<br>
<br>
You see this especially in the area of integration. SAAS providers of different, inter-related applications often work together in partnerships to make sure their applications work together seamlessly, using published data transfer protocols. With web services, data can be brought in in real time. Again, this level of investment often isn't available to our corporate systems, and so we end up with kludged joins between applications, and impenetrable users interfaces that wouldn't survive a minute in the open market.<br>
 <br>
So, what's the future for corporate IT, when much of what they offer has been commoditised?<br>
 <br>
<h3>Work with the SAAS providers</h3><br>
 <br>
If you can't compete, then join with them. Build partnerships so that you can recommend cost-effective solutions to your business. Your job will be to carry out all the necessary <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/10/06/cloud-systems-security-questions?blog=5">due diligence</a> to make sure the service you'll get is as good, and as secure, as anything you could have provided internally.<br>
 <br>
Why would you want to manage systems like email, CRM, finance, collaboration etc, when these are now no longer specialist systems? Instead, find a trusted partner who can just pull you into their existing infrastructure.<br>
 <br>
<h3>Focus on the difficult bits to make them easier</h3><br>
 <br>
There will be some corporate systems that don't have an equivalent in the SAAS world. They're so specialised that no-one's going to commoditise them. Focus on these and, in particular, on where they will join up with other systems. Standardise on the data interfaces to make it easier to join them up to other systems. Consider designing those systems so they could themselves become multi-tenanted. You never know, what you're building might be a SAAS system of the future!<br>
 <br>
<h3>Become a trusted partner</h3><br>
 <br>
If you're seen to have the best interests of the business and its users at heart, regardless of whether you provide the solution or not, then you will be the people the business turns to to solve their problems. Instead of being a blocker to the business, the IT department becomes an enabler.</div><h1>The Learning Explosion</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 11 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Great video from <a href="http://www.nigelpaine.com/">Nigel Paine</a>, produced by <a href="http://goodpractice.com/blog/the-learning-explosion-nigel-paine/">GoodPractice</a>, focussing on how learning will become central to organisational effectiveness.<br>
<br>
But, for that to happen, our whole thinking about the "learning" function needs to change. It's not about knowledge, or even competencies. It's about how people really behave.<br>
<br>
[youtube]bUDVJl_znGM[/youtube]</div><h1>Membership organisations - are they past their sell-by date?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>@CraigTaylor74 suggested I write this article, following a brief twitter conversation, during which I stated that I was unlikely to join the <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/">ELearning Network</a> or any other paid-for membership organisation.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What I'm going to say below may be based&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;misunderstanding&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;true&nbsp;situation,&nbsp;so&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;really&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;any&nbsp;feedback.&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;prepared&nbsp;to&nbsp;have&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind&nbsp;changed!&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the field of learning &amp; development there are a multitude of professional organisations you could join: <a href="http://www.astd.org/">ASTD</a>, <a href="http://www.learningandperformanceinstitute.com/">Learning and Performance Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/">Elearning Network</a>, <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/">Association for Learning Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/">Chartered Institute for Performance and Development</a>, <a href="http://www.thebild.org/">British Institute for Learning &amp; Development</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Pre-Internet, there was definitely a place for such organisations, but I would question their relevance in a world where we can all easily build up professional networks and trusted sources of information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What do these membership organisations offer in return for your cash?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<ul><br>
&nbsp; <li>Access to knowledge and new ideas</li><br>
&nbsp; <li>Recognition of your skills and experience</li><br>
&nbsp; <li>Collective access to senior policy makers<br>(although that is only the stated aim of one or two of the organisations)</li><br>
</ul><br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'll look at each of these in turn:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Access to knowledge and new ideas</h3><br>
&nbsp;<br>
I follow 888 people or organisations on Twitter, and track 413 blogs and other sites via Google Reader. Why do I need to pay to be part of a group of people, when they are already sharing their knowledge quite readily for free?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We're in what is known as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>", where people give away services for free. The expectation is that, even if you are initially solely a consumer, you may eventually be in a position to give away your knowledge too.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I agree, however, that there is a place for events where you can get direct access to individuals with knowledge. But I don't want to just be on the receiving end of a presentation - I'm looking for conversation. The presentation could have been done in advance through technology. I want to be in a group that is discussing ideas, not just consuming them. These events cost money to run, I know. But they don't have to be expensive - just look at the wave of <a href="http://www.teachmeet.org.uk/">Teachmeets</a> going across the UK - even now into <a href="http://www.oliverquinlan.com/blog/2011/10/28/teachmeet-plymouth-buzzing-about-behaviour/">teacher training</a>. With a bit of careful sponsorship, they could even be free.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Recognition of your skills and experience</h3><br>
&nbsp;<br>
When you're starting off in a career, qualifications are what counts. You've got nothing else to prove that you know what you're about.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As you progress, it's your reputation that becomes more important than your qualifications. I try not to keep track of how many followers I have, or who's reading my blog (given the stats engine on my blog software, that's pretty difficult anyway...), but my gut feel is that, amongst my peers, I've got a reasonable reputation. I hope someone would tell me if otherwise!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The problem comes when your employer, or potential employer, knows nothing about blogs, Twitter et al. And then it becomes a case of pieces of paper, backed up with tales of how well you've done at your previous jobs. That's where my LinkedIn profile comes in handy, as it's where I keep an up-to-date account of my jobs and achievements.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I did go for the <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/get-involved/certified-membership">CMALT</a> (Certified Member of the Association for Learning Technology) qualification, and held that for a year. But I've let my ALT membership lapse now, so can't use those letters after my name any more. Not that it was important though, since, in corporate L&amp;D, very few people really know about ALT anyway.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And that's the problem. There is no real, recognised qualification scheme that I fit into. There's no way I'd go down the CIPD route, as that would push me into HR and generic training manager roles - even though I do small bits of that. Similarly with the Learning &amp; Performance Institute, as their qualifications are all about trainers and facilitators, even though I do some of that too.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For people like me, at the cross-over between IT, L&amp;D and management consultancy, there is no professional body to join. And that's unlikely to change, since we're not a homogenous group of people. We all have different needs and experiences. Just like I don't fit into our competency framework, I'm not going to fit a certification scheme.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Collective access to senior policy makers</h3><br>
&nbsp;<br>
To be honest, I think ALT is the only learning technology related organisation that has a need to change public policies - given their roots in Further and Higher Education. If I was working in those sectors, then I'd definitely be an ALT member - mainly for that reason. The equivalent organisation in the primary &amp; secondary sectors is <a href="http://www.naace.co.uk/">NAACE</a> - which I was also a member of for a while. But, working in the private sector, you feel very removed from government policy. Which is probably why none of the professional bodies seem to be at all worried about lobbying for policy changes. (At least, as far as I can see).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is where the real strength of a membership organisation can be found. Just like unions, which exist to support each individual member when in need and to promote the needs of the entire membership, there is strength in numbers. It means you have the finances to provide support when needed, and it means people will listen to you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our professional membership bodies, however, don't seem to have any form of mutual support built into them (that's not what they're there for), and no clear idea of who needs to listen to them. They just become organisations for sharing ideas - which, as I said earlier - I can get elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</div><h1>Mobile content delivery 2</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>This is a follow up to an <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/10/28/mobile-content-delivery?blog=5">earlier post on Mobile Content Delivery</a>, where I looked at the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods available.<br>
<br>
I've been digging a bit further into what's available to help you get your content into mobile devices. What follows is a brain dump of my current state of knowledge... I'll be focussing on iOS devices (as that's all I've got to experiment with), but there are significant downsides to this, as you'll see below.<br>
<br>
<h3>PDF</h3><br>
<br>
PDF files are probably the easiest way to distribute content that is purely static (ie. no animations) text and graphics. On an iPad you can save them into your iBooks collection. They can be read offline; are searchable; easy to browse and can contain internal and external hyperlinks.<br>
<br>
They're also really easy to deploy; either as a download, or attached to an email.<br>
<br>
Creating them can be as simple, or as complex as you wish. At its simplest, you can print to a pdf from any application that allows printing, including Word, Powerpoint, Keynote etc. Or you can do high-end work using desktop-publishing software in combination with tools like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.html">Adobe Acrobat</a>.<br>
<br>
The downside with a pdf, at least with the default iPad reader, is that you can't copy any of the text or images, nor use any of iBook's note-taking, highlighting or dictionary functions. Also, the only way to enlarge text is to zoom in on the pages - as opposed to eBooks which reflow text when you enlarge it.<br>
<br>
<h3>eBooks</h3><br>
<br>
eBooks are as simple as PDF's to deploy. They have a couple of advantages over pdf's though:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Ability to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#E-books">incorporate DRM</a> (eg. as used by <a href="http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/leisure/libraries/ebooks/default.asp">Derbyshire libraries</a> - I use <a href="http://www.bluefirereader.com/">Bluefire Reader</a> on my iPad to read the book, as it has some sort of integration with the AdobeID which the libraries use for authentication and DRM).</li><br>
  <li>Able to use a wider range of functions than is available in the PDF reader - eg. notes, copy, highlighting, change text size</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
On the DRM front, it's worth noting that O'Reilly (one of the world's largest technical publishers) does not use DRM on its eBooks, yet has still seen <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/01/2009-oreilly-ebook-revenue-up-104-percent.html">massive growth on sales of eBooks</a>. From the end-user's perspective, they run the risk of losing DRM-protected eBooks they've paid for at the whim of the supplier.<br>
<br>
eBooks are not as easy to create as PDF's. However they are not difficult, if you have a reasonable understanding of HTML and CSS.<br>
<br>
eBooks have a standard format, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">ePub</a>. An ePub file is basically a zip file but with a .epub extension to the filename. If you rename the file so it has a .zip extension, you'll be able to unzip it and take a look inside, where you'll find:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>A set of html or xhtml pages - these are the pages of your book. Each page is completely separate, although you can have links between them. The eBook software will handle creating the table of contents</li><br>
  <li>Any associated CSS files and images, often inside sub-folders</li><br>
  <li>A couple of XML files that contain: 1) A list of all the files in the eBook, and 2) the table of contents</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
It's slightly more complicated than that. For a really good introduction to ePub files, and how to build them by hand, look at http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/<br>
<br>
You can be quite creative with eBooks, as shown by the <a href="http://epubzengarden.com/">ePub Zen Garden</a> site, but you don't have total control of the layout, particularly where images are concerned, as the eBook software will shift things around to get the best fit on the page.<br>
<br>
There are two main (free) tools around to help you create ePub files:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sigil/">Sigil</a> - which describes itself as a WYSIWYG eBook editor</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> - which is an eBook management programme, which can also create eBooks from other formats</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
If your starting point is a Word doc or similar, and the pages are quite simple, then look at Calibre. As long as your Word doc is nicely formatted (using styles - see <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/04/working-efficiently-word-processing?blog=5">Working Efficiently: Word Processing</a>) then Calibre should have no problem turning it into an ePub file which can go straight into your eBook reader.<br>
<br>
You'll have limited control over the output, but it's a simple process.<br>
<br>
If you are starting from scratch, then I'd recommend Sigil. It lets you write each page in turn and builds the XML files for you. And, if you know some HTML and CSS, you can have quite a bit of control over the look and feel. You can even have <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/">floating divs</a> (if that's what rocks your boat!)<br>
<br>
It's best to keep eBooks as simple as possible, because not all eBook readers will support every HTML and CSS element. The more complex you make it, eg. with embedded media and imported CSS, the more testing you're going to have to do on your target devices and reader applications.<br>
<br>
<h3>Pure native applications</h3><br>
<br>
By pure native application, I mean one that is crafted using the native coding system required by the device. For iOS devices, this is <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html">Objective-C</a>. It may be built by hand, or using some sort of automated tool.<br>
<br>
The problem I've had with this approach is that I can get so far, but no further.<br>
<br>
For one thing, not having been brought up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented programming</a>, I've got an incredibly steep learning curve before I can do anything remotely useful.<br>
<br>
For another, even though I've now upgraded my Mac from OSX 10.4 (thanks to <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/meadowhall/">Apple store: Meadowhall</a> for all their help with this), and have now got <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> (the development environment) installed, I can't deploy even the tiniest test app to my iPad or any other device without paying $99 per year for the privilege, and going through incredibly convoluted deployment processes.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I understand the philosophy behind this, apart from Apple's desire to control the flow of apps. It creates a barrier to entry that only allows through those who are really serious about app development, with no room for those who are trying it out for size.<br>
<br>
Yes, the <a href="https://market.android.com/?hl=en">Android Marketplace</a> is <del>a mess, with no quality control whatsoever</del> more of an open market, with market-drive controls [updated following conversations with someone who's got more experience here than I have]. But, it does mean that the new generation of developers are going to get their formative experiences (when they've got no money) with Android devices.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, assuming you have a paid-up Apple Developer account, you've got a number of options to create content-based apps:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Handcode using Xcode - but this is not for the faint-hearted!</li><br>
  <li>Use an online tool like <a href="http://www.buzztouch.com/">Buzztouch</a> or <a href="http://www.appinventorbeta.com/about/">Google's App Inventor</a> - which provide a building-block approach to app building. Buzztouch is multi-platform (although the most recent version is currently iOS only), whilst App Inventor is Android only. They help you to create the code, and then allow you to download it to tweak offline and then deploy.</li><br>
  <li>Use a high end toolset like the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitalpublishingsuite/">Adobe Digital Publishing Suite</a> to build highly interactive, content-based apps, like the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/mobile/ipad/guardian-ipad-edition">Guardian iPad Edition</a> - which certainly is extremely good-looking, and highly usable - but very expensive to produce unless that's all you do...</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Web applications compiled as native applications</h3><br>
<br>
The alternative to learning native code is to build your content using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript - just like a website - and then package it in such a way so it can be deployed as an app.<br>
<br>
Building the content then becomes the easy bit (as long as you follow good design practice, often using grid-based CSS which can adapt to the available screen size, eg. <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a>, <a href="http://framelessgrid.com/">Frameless Grid</a>, or <a href="http://www.asidemag.com/grid/">Magazine Grid</a>). You can even add a lot of interactivity using Javascript such as the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch framework</a> - although this can get complex quite quickly - it's best if you're reasonably happy with tweaking Javascript.<br>
<br>
You then need to wrap it in some code which the mobile device will recognise as pure app code.<br>
<br>
This has already been done for you.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> lets you deploy to multiple platforms, and lets developers make use of the specific features of those platforms, eg. accelerometers or GPS. Deployment can be simple (eg. to Nokia S60 platforms) or complex (eg. to iOS devices - as described above). You will need to know a little bit about your target platform's native code to get the best out of PhoneGap.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, if you're using iOS, and you're just deploying content, then look at the <a href="http://bakerframework.com/">Baker eBook Framework</a>. It's similar to ePub, in that you create all your content using multiple html files in a single folder. But the Baker Framework then provides the Objective-C code which transforms the pages into apps that can be sold through the App Store, with built-in navigation and page turn effects.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.lakercompendium.com/">Laker Compendium</a> takes things to the next stage, by combing the Less Framework (for design), the Baker Framework V2 (for deployment), <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">JQuery</a> (for interactions like double-taps and swipes), and <a href="http://jplayer.org/">JPlayer</a> (for playing rich media). It really is very simple to use, and quite beautiful to work with. It's a great way of creating magazine-type apps. But, again, it relies on you having an Apple Developer Account if you want to actually have people using it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Pure web applications</h3><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a title="Aside Magazine" href="http://www.asidemag.com/"><img class="rightmargin" alt="Screen shot of Aside Magazine" src="./assets/01-web-screens.jpg" width="200" height="261"></a></div><br>
If you don't want to use any of the device-specific App Stores you can just use the tools above, like Magazine Grid and Sencha Touch to create what are essentially, mobile friendly web-sites. But, with the right bits of code, these display as applications within the device.<br>
<br>
The key thing to remember, is that, unless the site has been programmed to save all the content to the device, your users will need to be online to view the content.<br>
<br>
The other thing to think about is whether you want payment for access to the content. If you do, then you'll need to build some sort of back-end system that has a user management and authentication process. That's not at all trivial. The <a href="http://openappmkt.com/">OpenAppMkt</a> provides an optional payment mechanism, although it's difficult to know quite how that works, since the developer just provides a link to their mobile-website - which is on the open internet anyway. I'd welcome some enlightenment on that one...<br>
<br>
If you don't want payment, then you can put web-apps on the open internet. For a great example of what's possible, see: http://www.asidemag.com/ - best viewed on an iPad.<br>
<br>
<h3>Content creation services</h3><br>
<br>
The final option for creating content, particularly when it's geared around learning, is to use an existing service that already has an approved app in the App Store. Examples include <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/product/pastiche">Xyleme's Pastiche</a>, <a href="http://www.gomolearning.com/site/">Epic's GoMo</a>, and <a href="http://www.upsidelearning.com/mobile-learning-solution-upside2go.asp">Upside Learning's Upside2Go</a>.<br>
<br>
All of these offer tools to help you create content, quizzes and other interactions, and then to deploy them through an existing app.<br>
<br>
Although these services provide a lot of capability, they do also limit what you can do. You'll end up with quite a templated approach, which may become frustrating if your target audience develops faster than the service provider - a situation that is increasingly common with the rapid pace of technology adoption.</div><h1>Note about the Android Marketplace</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 14 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>One of the comments I made in <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/11/14/mobile-content-delivery-2?blog=5">my previous post</a>, was about the Android Marketplace being a mess.<br>
<br>
I've since had a conversation with a colleague who has far greater experience of Android than I have.<br>
<br>
It's not that the Marketplace is a mess, it's more a case that it's a true open-market. Anyone can submit applications, and then the rest of the community rates those applications and can flag up ones that are dodgy or malicious.<br>
<br>
It's a case of buyer beware - either don't download something that hasn't been rated positively by a number of people, or be prepared to do your own testing.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that clarifies things.</div><h1>If you're asking "Why?"</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 18 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>There are times when I wonder about the whole purpose and rationale of the work I do. Where does it fit into the grand scheme of things? What real benefit am I bringing to humanity?<br>
<br>
Big questions.<br>
<br>
Often, they're very hard to answer. Especially when you're a small cog in a big, corporate machine.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, however, I came across something that indicated that at least some of what I do can have wider meaning than just helping people use technology better...<br>
<br>
When you can use that technology to create something beautiful.<br>
<br>
When it's not about the technology, but about bringing together people from across the world with one creative purpose.<br>
<br>
I wasn't part of this particular project, but it shows amazingly what is possible. I'm hoping as you watch this you will see the potential that technology offers to enable participation in creating solutions.<br>
<br>
Even if you don't, just enjoy the experience!<br>

</object></div><h1>Ebooks and libraries</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 29 November 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've started using <a href="http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/leisure/libraries/ebooks/default.asp">Derbyshire County Council's ebook loan service</a> recently. Once you get past the initial setup stage (which really is too convoluted for the general user), it works very well.<br>
<br>
The only problem is the extremely limited range of books available - particularly non-fiction.<br>
<br>
Given that digital services are not dependent on location, I can't understand why each local authority needs to run their own ebook library? Why not have a single, national library, part-funded by the local authorities (based on their size) and part-funded by an annual subscription from the users. I don't know how much libraries pay for their books, so can't put any figures on the subscription, but it needs to be less than you'd pay to rent videos!<br>
<br>
What's stopping this happening, apart from the political will?</div><h1>Internal communication - past repair?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 December 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Our internal communications processes are broken. Email memos sent down from on high very rarely get cascaded to everyone that should see them. The people on the ground don't believe anyone is listening to them. Information on corporate intranets is rarely up-to-date, or relevant. And, with information  dotted around our organisations, there is no individual person who has all the current information you need, just when you need it.<br>
<br>
I would suggest three things have contributed to this breakdown:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Organisations have grown far beyond the point where normal, face-to-face networks can operate effectively. It's not enough now to rely on knowing someone in your team who knows who to talk to. For one thing it's not quick enough, and often the people that you need to talk to will be several contacts removed from you.</li><br>
  <li>Hierarchical management structures have created stagnant information silos. To remain useful, information needs to be constantly refreshed and be joined up to other information. Hierarchies are designed for top-down command and control, and cannot handle the rapid flow of information that is essential in a rapidly changing business and social environment.</li><br>
  <li>Our unintelligent use of email has given rise to communication practices that are incredibly inefficient; both in terms of the amount of storage required, and in terms of the time it takes to get things done. Multiple copies of every email and every attachment have to be kept somewhere, often for many years. Every person that is added to an email's distribution list means that yet more storage is required. Many times emails are not sent to all the right people, or are sent to far more people than necessary. So we end up with time being wasted in dealing with messages that don't need a response, or dealing with multiple conversation threads, all ostensibly about the same topic, but sent to different people.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
One company, <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/">Atos</a> (a global IT Services organisation) has attacked this problem head-on. Over the course of the next three years they will be <a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3260053/atos-origin-abandoning-email/">mandating that employees do not use email for any internal communication</a>.<br>
<br>
Instead, they will use a combination of social networking and instant messaging tools (ie. just like our kids do currently).<br>
<br>
This will solve all three problems above:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Online social networking allows messages to fly around networks extremely rapidly. If you ask a question, your contacts may not know the answer, but will repost it to their contacts etc.</li><br>
  <li>By connecting people across the hierarchy, information will flow, connect and make new information. It will drive innovation and reduce duplication.</li><br>
  <li>Each message is only ever stored once. And each message is searchable, and auditable.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Email will never go away. It's valuable to have somewhere that you get notified about new messages. You might even use email to post things into central conversations (just like you can do with <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>). But, as a place where conversations happen, and messages get stored, its days are numbered.</div><h1>Web marketing and Learning Conversations</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 December 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>I've started getting a number of queries from web marketing companies (who will remain nameless!) wanting to pay me to put links into my posts.<br>
<br>
The conversation normally goes like this:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Marketing company: Hi there, we'd like to pay you $x if you'll put a link to my client's website in your post at http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/[post_url]<br>
<br>
Me: Thanks for the offer. Yes, that's fine, as long as I can put it in a section explicitly marked as advertising.<br>
<br>
Marketing company: No, the link needs to be embedded in the post. Something like: "If you're interested in <a href="file:///Users/markberthelemy/Google%20Drive/R&amp;D/LearningConversations/exportlc.php.html#">[service offered with link to relevant page]</a>, [Client] offers [service description]<br>
<br>
Me: So you're asking me to break the Advertising Standards Authority rules which govern UK advertising? No thanks.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Just for the record, I will not accept advertising unless I can explicitly mark it as advertising copy. Any links that you come across in my posts are there just because I thought they'd be useful, and not because I've been paid to put them there.<br>
<br>
And, if you're not clear what the rules are:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cap.org.uk/The-Codes/CAP-Code/CAP-Code-Item.aspx?q=CAP+Code+new_General+Sections_02+Recognition+of+marketing+communications_Rules#c48">Committee of Advertising Practice &gt; Recognition of Marketing Communications &gt; Rules</a><br>
<br>
2.1 Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such.<br>
2.2 Unsolicited e-mail marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as marketing communications without the need to open them (see rule 10.6).<br>
2.3 Marketing communications must not falsely claim or imply that the marketer is acting as a consumer or for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession; marketing communications must make clear their commercial intent, if that is not obvious from the context.<br>
2.4 Marketers and publishers must make clear that advertorials are marketing communications; for example, by heading them “advertisement feature”.<br>
<br>
Don't ask me to break them!</div><h1>Building your <del>social</del>, <del>mobile</del> learning <del>technology</del> strategy</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 December 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Lots of organisations are looking through their corporate boundaries and realising that the world outside is changing - and fast!<br>
<br>
Whereas fifteen years ago mobile phones were still quite new, now they are ubiquitous. Being constantly in touch and available has become the norm, so much so that people have to <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2011/11/01/incoming-belshawblackops11/">announce that they are going "offline"</a><br>
<br>
The Internet has taken over from the High Street as the place where people shop and communicate. And now distance and national borders are really no barrier. Our networks of trusted suppliers and contacts are geographically dispersed; often to the extent that we don't even know where they are located.<br>
<br>
When I was a child, when I needed to find something out for school homework, I'd turn to our set of Everyman's Encyclopaedia or take a trip to our local library. My own children now have the collected knowledge of the world at their fingertips. The skills they need to interpret and use it are far more advanced than anything I had to do.<br>
<br>
Organisations that have direct contact with real people (ie. not business to business organisations) know that expectations have changed, and have had to change their sales, marketing and delivery processes to reflect them. These organisations tend to be the ones that have realised they also need to change the way they deal with people inside the corporate boundary.<br>
<br>
These changes are particularly pertinent to learning and development, which is the cross-over point between internal communications and operations. We have to constantly reassess how we are working to remain relevant.<br>
<br>
However, too many times, we simply pick up on the latest buzzword for the year and create a strategy to reflect it. So we end up with elearning strategies, social learning strategies and mobile learning strategies; all sitting separate to our core operation which continues delivering classroom-based training...<br>
<br>
I wonder how many organisations, if asked, would be able to describe their learning strategy? How many would  be able to show how their Learning &amp; Development teams directly make a difference to the ongoing success of the organisation? How many would be able to show, by reference to research (not psycho-babble and hype), how their approaches to learning will actually help people to learn? How many would even know what they meant by "learning" in their particular context? And why is that particular "learning" needed anyway?<br>
<br>
When I was working in schools, I came across many policy documents around homework, special educational needs, health and safety, report writing, learning styles (<a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/learning_styles.htm">please don't start me on that!</a>) etc, but only once did I find a school that had explicitly described its approach to learning.<br>
<br>
What did it include?<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A statement of the school's aims</li><br>
  <li>The quality indicators that would be used</li><br>
  <li>Examples of good practice</li><br>
  <li>What we know from neuro-science about the brain and learning</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
So, what should you consider in a corporate learning strategy?<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Your stakeholders</li><br>
  <li>What you're trying to achieve and how you will know whether you've achieved it</li><br>
  <li>Engagement approach with your stakeholders</li><br>
  <li>What we know about learning from research</li><br>
  <li>The role of managers</li><br>
  <li>The role of the l&amp;d professional</li><br>
  <li>Your approach to trying new ideas</li><br>
  <li>Your approach to communicating and rolling out new ideas</li><br>
  <li>The technology toolkit that is available. This will keep changing, but it will need to be in a controlled manner</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Each of these is worth a post on their own - that's the plan.</div><h1>Is your website legal?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 15 December 2011</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Probably not.<br>
<br>
In the UK, there are a number of things your website must do.<br>
<br>
Some only apply to companies. For example, your website falls under the same law as headed notepaper and invoices.<br>
<br>
Basically this means that you must display:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The company name</li><br>
  <li>The company number</li><br>
  <li>Place of registration</li><br>
  <li>Registered office address</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
See: <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/faq/tradingDisclosures.shtml">Companies House FAQ on Trading Disclosures</a><br>
<br>
Some apply to virtually everyone. In particular, the new rule that says you must ask visitors if they are happy to accept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a>.<br>
<br>
See: <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx">Information Commissioner's Office Guide to Cookies</a> and <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2011/must-try-harder-on-cookies-compliance-says-ico-13122011.aspx">today's news article from ICO</a>.<br>
<br>
The trouble with this rule is that almost every modern website or web application uses cookies. It might be to track visitors, or even just to keep a record that they've logged in.<br>
<br>
This rule doesn't appear to have been tested in the courts yet. So take any guidance given by non-lawyers as questionable. But here are a few places offering advice:<br>

<br>
Thanks to <a href="http://digitalbydefault.com/2011/12/14/a-crack-in-the-cookie-craziness/">Matt Jukes</a> for getting me thinking on this one.</div><h1>Who's brand are you building?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 January 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you self-publish, whether on a blog, a Youtube channel, on Twitter or even books and ebooks, then who owns the brand that you're building? You, or the organisation you're associated with?<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2011/jun/22/laura-kuenssberg-twitter-account">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16338040">Phonedog</a> have recently had to address this, with regards to Twitter accounts "owned" by personalities within their organisations.<br>
<br>
It's a difficult question to answer without a specific context, but I'd like to offer a few guiding principles that might help protect both the individual and their organisation. As always, I'd welcome any feedback to help refine these...<br>
<br>
<h3>For the individual</h3><br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Don't mention the organisation you are associated with anywhere on your personally published materials</li><br>
<li>Put a disclaimer on your materials along the lines of: <blockquote>Disclaimer: The contents of this website do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employer nor any other organisation with which I am associated.</blockquote></li><br>
<li>Don't publish anything that is going to cause any embarrassment to your organisation. If in doubt - ask before publishing. It's very hard to retract things.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
<h3>For the organisation</h3><br>
<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Use more than one author on your blog, Twitter account etc</li><br>
<li>Don't use an individual's name on your blog/Twitter account unless you have a clear agreement with the individual that they will lose control of these accounts if they move to a different organisation. This is especially true for public systems like Twitter.</li><br>
<li>Have a clear distinction between personal publishing and corporate publishing, with policies that release individuals to publish, whilst protecting the organisation.</li><br>
</ol></div><h1>Standardisation versus Innovation</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 January 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>As businesses scale-up their operations they have to standardise on things like technology platforms and processes.<br>
<br>
But where does that leave innovation - which is essential for companies to maintain their competitive edge?<br>
<br>
Standardisation is all about minimising risk whilst maximising throughput. It makes sense, but it can lead to unwieldy systems that are like oil tankers when asked to make changes.<br>
<br>
Compare this to small start-up companies, which change direction like a champion downhill bike rider. (If you don't know what this is like, see the amazing video below!) They try things out, often with little regard to the risks, which are small at this stage in their development.<br>
<br>
The challenge is for small start-ups to learn some of the standardisation practices of the large companies (otherwise they'll remain forever small), and for the large companies to adopt some of the innovation techniques of the small companies, without compromising on risk.<br>
<br>
For the large companies, it's not just about allowing time to communication and innovate (like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/company/culture.html">Google</a>). It's also about providing test-beds where ideas can be tried out in safe ways. Sometimes these will need to be client-facing - as long as you've got a good enough relationship with the client so that they know they're acting as beta testers.<br>
<br>
For the small companies, it's about identifying the things you do that can be replicated and documented so that, as you grow, new people can slot in easily. It's things like this that will make you attractive to the larger clients.<br>

<a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/speakers/gareth-williams/">Gareth Williams</a> and I are leading a <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/track-3-session-22/">conference workshop</a> on this topic on the Wednesday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the key points and questions to get us thinking:<br>
<br>
<h3>The problem</h3><br>
<br>
However important we think our learning interventions are, to the majority of learners they are likely to feel like, at best, an imposition, and, at worst, an irrelevant waste of time.<br>
<br>
There are things that we need to address even before learners get to our carefully crafted materials. If we don't deal with them, then we will have wasted our own time and money.<br>
<br>
<h3>Removing the blockers</h3><br>
<br>
You need to do everything possible to remove any technical difficulties that will stop people getting to your learning materials.<br>
<br>
There are two possible routes to this:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Provide support</li><br>
<li>Make sure the technology used is as simple and user-friendly as possible</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Question: How often do we compensate for poorly designed systems with support desks and FAQs?<br>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3><br>
<br>
People will only learn if they are motivated to do so. For many, they will be extrinsically motivated (using techniques like reward, punishment and coercion), but really, we should be trying to move toward intrinsic motivation, where people do things out of interest, a sense of autonomy, or enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Unless we deal with the blockers and motivation, we might as well not waste our money on trying to get people to learn!<br>
<br>
Question: What works to motivate people to learn?<br>
<br>
<h3>Behaviours</h3><br>
<br>
We all behave in different ways in different situations. When dealing with learning interventions, it's the task of the designer, or facilitator, to make sure that participants understand, and accept, the conventions, standards and practices that will be needed.<br>
<br>
When people come into a new situation, and don't understand how things work, they will quickly lose any motivation they came with. This applies to books, elearning modules, online discussions, classroom training etc. All of these have certain conventions attached that new participants will need to align to very quickly.<br>
<br>
Question: Think of a learning intervention. What did you do to help people learn the social norms? (Note - it doesn't have to be an explicit explanation!)<br>
<br>
<h3>Communication</h3><br>
<br>
Effective communication is at the heart of learning activity. Whether it's one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. It's our job, as facilitators of learning, to make sure that communication is made as easy as possible, and as clear as possible.<br>
<br>
As soon as a learner becomes awash in a sea of information, or, even worse, adrift in an information desert, it often becomes easier to just give up.<br>
<br>
Effective communication is partly about the content, and how it's presented. But it's also about timing.<br>
<br>
Every learning intervention should come with a communications plan, where you set out how and when you will communicate with the learners.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/comms_timing.png"><img alt="Communication and timing" src="./assets/comms_timing.png" width="500" height="167"></a></div><br>
<br>
It's about giving people the information they need, just when they need it to push them onto the next stage.<br>
<br>
Question: What one thing could you do to improve communication around your learning programmes?<br>
<br>
<h3>Management</h3><br>
<br>
It's very easy, even when you have highly motivated learners and no blockers, to stifle learners' engagement. Particularly so if their managers aren't aligned with the way the learning intervention needs to work.<br>
<br>
So, you need to be working with the managers, so they can set the right expectations with their teams, so they can promote the value of the learning activity, and so they will give permission for people to spend valuable time working on learning.<br>
<br>
Question: What is the best approach to take with managers to get them to support and promote learning?<br>
<br>

Credit: Many of the ideas in this presentation are based on the early parts of Gilly Salmon's <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">Five Stage Model</a>.</div><h1>Highly cost effective video-based learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 January 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>You've identified a learning need. Let's say you need people to know the best way to use a particular piece of equipment. In this case, there is only one way to use it, and the aim is to save people time rather than get them to understand the disadvantages of using it wrongly.<br>
<br>
By far the best way to approach this learning problem is likely to be with live action video.<br>
<br>
There are four things to consider:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>How will you record the video?</li><br>
<li>How will you edit the video?</li><br>
<li>How will learners find the video?</li><br>
<li>How will you measure the results?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<h3>Recording</h3><br>
The example below was recorded using a very low cost, handheld <a href="http://support.theflip.com/en-uk/home">Flip video camera</a> - now, sadly, not in production, but there are many similar products, including the rather excellent <a href="http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Zi8_Pocket_Video_Camera/productID.156585800">Kodak Zi-8</a>.<br>
<br>
The commentary was recorded using my PC headset - again, nothing special.<br>
<br>
The key thing was the planning. I'd worked out the process that I needed to explain beforehand, and then ran through the process whilst recording in a series of shots.<br>
<br>
Total filming time: 15 minutes<br>
<br>
<h3>Editing</h3><br>
The raw footage was pulled into iMovie (which comes free with any Mac). There are similar free tools available for Windows (eg. <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-movie-maker-get-started">Windows Movie Maker</a>).<br>
<br>
The editing process consisted simply of trimming the shots where necessary, joining them together with (subtle) transitions, recording the commentary (whilst still keeping the sounds recorded during the filming to provide an audio backdrop), and then adding the titles.<br>
<br>
Total editing time: 60 minutes - just because I was learning how to do it at the same time.<br>
<h3>Distribution</h3><br>
The film was recorded because I knew, from personal experience, that there was no help available for this particular task, and wanted to share what I had learnt.<br>
<br>
I wanted to make it as widely available as possible, as the potential audience was worldwide. If I'd wanted to limit the audience then it would have made distribution far, far harder!<br>
<br>
So I popped it on Youtube. There are two versions - with different levels of rendering quality. (Again, I was experimenting here).<br>
<br>
Total time for worldwide distribution: 15 minutes<br>
<br>
<h3>Results</h3><br>
After a year, between the two versions, the video has been viewed 25,000 times. To me that's phenomenal! After all, it's only about changing a car lightbulb!<br>
<br>
There have been 44 comments so far - mostly expressing how much time has been saved. I would expect (from my experience of social media) that these comments reflect a much greater number of people who didn't comment. Going on the <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2008/05/another-application-for-100101-rule.html">100:10:1</a> ratio normally quoted, I would estimate 4000 people have saved about £7 each (based on the the Halfords price for changing light bulbs). That's a total of £28,000! Imagine that reflected in your organisation...<br>

The classrooms had machines like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Machines_380Z">RM 380Z</a>, with very little software (if any), and few teachers that had a clue what to do with them. Similarly our homes had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">Sinclair Spectrums</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">ZX81's</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64's</a>. I even had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore PET</a> (image below) at one point. The common factor with all of these is that, on booting up, they just came up with something as helpful as:<br>
 <br>
<blockquote class="left"><br>
<br>
<p>&gt; <span style="text-decoration: blink;">|</span></p><br>
<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><a href="./assets/480px-Commodore_2001_Series-IMG_0448b.jpg"><img alt="Commodore PET" src="./assets/480px-Commodore_2001_Series-IMG_0448b.jpg" width="480" height="480"></a><p>Just look at that 300 baud tape deck!</p><p>Image credit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Wikipedia</a></p></div><br>
 <br>
We learnt how to program by typing code in from magazines and then working through it to solve all the problems - in a very similar way to children learning a spoken language: mimic and then trial and error. In fact, very similar to the way this modern <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/">Python programming book</a> works.<br>
 <br>
It's this that launched the games and software industry in the UK, and I expect elsewhere too.<br>
 <br>
But then computers started getting more "friendly". They came pre-populated with software that lets you carry out tasks like word-processing and data manipulation. The focus, in schools, turned to understanding how to best use those software tools, rather than how to make new tools.<br>
 <br>
It's like we've ended up with people able to drive in the safe environment of the left-hand lane (UK &amp; a few other countries only!) of a motorway, but with very little idea of how to make use of all three lanes, or what to do if there's a crash up ahead, and no knowledge whatsoever of how the car actually works or how to tweak it so it can go off-road.<br>
 <br>
This approach has led to ICT becoming a very functional (boring), and unchallenging subject at school. Whereas it could be highly creative, full of opportunities to develop transferable skills in problem-solving and logical thought.<br>
 <br>
I'm not fussed about changing the name from ICT to computing, computer science or whatever. But we do need to make sure that it includes both the functional skills (eg. how to add a new post to your blog) and the computing skills (eg. the concept of write-once / read-many that is used in stylesheets, programming, and database design).<br>
 <br>
So many people have written on this subject already (including <a href="http://danielstucke.com/post/15685474628/bravo-mr-gove-schoolstech-ictcurric">this excellent summary from Daniel Stucke - an assistant headteacher in Manchester</a>), but I'm so glad Michael Gove has made the decision to push schools towards more of a computing approach. It's one of the few things he's done that I agree with! My only worry is that, as with many of the specialist subjects, there will be a severe lack of suitably confident teachers to take up the challenge - especially now that ICT will not have have any formal programme of study in the national curriculum.<br>
 <br>
Perhaps it's time, again, to provide the equipment (eg. the new, very cheap and very small, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> computer for kids - which seems to be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16424990">all</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/01/cheap-computing">over</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/10/computer-skills-ed-vaizey?newsfeed=true">the</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16544845">media</a> this week) and let the students get on with it themselves. Given appropriate challenges - even competition - and access to each other's ideas through social media, there's no reason the new generation of computer scientists can't grow from the ashes of the current ICT lesson.<br>
 <br>
With ICT, almost more than any other subject, you could argue the case for totally individualised learning, with teachers/coaches located anywhere - setting challenges and giving support. In fact, they don't need to be teachers. Just look at any large open-source project and you'll find people doing just that: identifying problems, setting challenges, and providing support. It's a highly scaleable model - based on a meritocracy, rather than any sort of qualification, or even age. The schools just need to be there to monitor and encourage...<br>
<br>

 <br>
All the time that learning is seen as something that's separate to work, that link is somewhat tenuous.<br>
 <br>
Sometimes it will be necessary to send an individual away for an extended period of time, to develop new skills or absorb new ideas. That's fine, as long as they are able to immediately practice those skills, or implement those ideas when they get back to work. If they don't, then much of the investment made in them will be wasted. This is primarily down to simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">forgetting</a>, but also a diminution of confidence that takes place when you take away the support structures of the "course".<br>
 <br>
In my experience, there are three ways to alleviate this problem:<br>
<ol><br>
<li>Extend your interventions into a longer period of time, so that they include post-course elements, such as coaching, just-in-time support materials, just-in-time support people, action learning sets etc.</li><br>
<li>Cut your interventions into much, much smaller chunks, delivered over a longer period of time, so that they can be used, and then put into practice immediately.</li><br>
<li>Build the interventions into chunks that can be used at the point of need - whether on a self-service basis, or as part of coaching, support or management. There's no point giving someone a book on using Word, if all they need is the chapter that explains how to use stylesheets. And there's no point giving them that chapter if no-one asks how they're getting on with stylesheets in their work.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
These methods aren't mutually exclusive. But the key thing to remember is that <em>real learning takes time and ongoing reinforcement</em>.<br>

<br>
Writing it down on a public blog allows me to get feedback which then feeds into further thinking and reflection.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd be quite lost without my blog now. It's been part of my life for over seven years.<br>
<br>
Whilst doing some research for a school I'm supporting informally, I've come across some great resources to help organisations and individuals get started out on incorporating blogging (or learning journals - if that sounds better) into their thinking and learning processes.<br>
<br>
The key one is <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AclS3lrlFkCIZGhuMnZjdjVfNzQ5ZnpiczlxYzM&amp;authkey=CN7tirgG&amp;hl=en_GB">64 interesting ideas for class blog posts</a>, which was a collaborative project organised by <a href="http://edte.ch/blog/">Tom Barrett</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/tombarrett">Twitter</a>. It's a Google Doc containing great ideas to kick start your blogging habit. Although it's aimed at the school classroom, there's no reason some of the ideas can't translate into corporate learning, or Further and Higher Education.<br>
<br>
Of course, blogs don't have to be written down. They could be presented as photos, audio, video or even animation. The main thing is that there has to be some thinking activity taking place to analyse, collate, organise, reflect, evaluate or synthesise. Without some or all of that, all you're doing is just acting as a conduit for other people's thinking, and not learning anything yourself.</div><h1>Campaign for Effective Elearning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 25 January 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#c4ee<br>
<br>
For a long time I have bewailed the poor quality of many of the elearning interventions that are used within the workplace. There are very few examples that I can honestly say would really make a difference - and by that I mean have a <strong>lasting</strong> impact on behaviours or performance.<br>
<br>
Partly that's to do with the way the interventions are designed, and partly it's down to how they are implemented.<br>
<br>
[Please note: I am using the word "intervention" deliberately, because I believe that elearning is (or should be) far, far richer than its seemingly accepted definition of a SCORM-packaged bundle of HTML and Flash content.]<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/">eLearning Network</a> has today launched their <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning">Campaign for Effective eLearning</a>, which "is waging a campaign to wipe out ineffective, inefficient, flabby elearning".<br>
<br>
If, as an industry, we can highlight demonstrably effective design and implementation practices, so that they become the accepted standard, we will, hopefully, be one step closer helping our clients make much better use of the online environment than currently.<br>
<br>
NB. Improved effectiveness does not equate to a higher price. As I hope I demonstrated in my post on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/01/07/highly-cost-effective-video-based?blog=5">cost-effective video-based learning</a>.<br>

<br>
This year, I was only able to attend the <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/conference/">Learning Technologies conference</a> for one day.<br>
<br>
Previous learning technology-related conferences that I've attended (not just Learning Technologies) have suffered from one major problem: They have not made best use of my time as a delegate.<br>
<br>
Being face-to-face with someone is a rare opportunity, and incredibly valuable. Yet we waste it on things that could be done just as effectively without requiring long-distance travel and hotel stays.<br>
<br>
What I want to do in that time is to take part in conversations - even if that's just listening in. It's the interaction between people that can only be done in a face-to-face environment which is worth paying for.<br>
<br>
So, this year, I decided to forego the pleasure of any of the conference sessions (except my own, of course - which I tried to make as interactive as possible!)<br>
<br>
Instead, I spent the day taking the opportunity to:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>catch up with contacts from LinkedIn and Twitter - including seeing my friends from <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/">Xyleme</a>, it was a very pleasant surprise seeing them over from Colorado</li><br>
<li>connect with current and potential suppliers</li><br>
<li>lead one of <a href="http://towardsmaturity.org/article/2012/01/11/learning-technology-exchange-new-2012/">Towards Maturity's Exchanges</a> on the exhibition floor - where a group of us basically held an impromptu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning">Action Learning</a> session, digging into a problem raised by one of the participants</li><br>
<li>have group conversations about the interface between learning and technology</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
This was by far the best use of the limited time I had, and by far the most useful conference I'd been to. I didn't come away with many new ideas, but, then, I get those on a daily basis through my RSS Reader and Twitter account. What did happen, through those conversations, was a refinement of my own ideas as they get knocked about by other people.<br>
<br>
If I get invited to run a session at another conference, I would like to run it completely differently. Rather than trying to squeeze short interactions into a presentation format, instead, I would like to work on the assumption that people are already up-to-date with my present thinking on the topic in question. Then we could build the whole session around facilitated conversations with each other.<br>
<br>
And if was running a conference like this, I would ask all my experts to publish their content somewhere in advance, and focus less on presentation, and far more on questions and conversation.<br>
<br>
It's all about practising what we preach as learning professionals!</div><h1>My elevator pitch</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 26 January 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>It's difficult to explain to people quite what I do at work, so I'm trying to pull some ideas together. Any contributions gladly received!<br>
<br>
<blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">Elevator pitch</a>:<br>
<br>
... a short summary used to quickly and simply define a product, service, or organization and its value proposition. The name "elevator pitch" reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
How's this for size:<br>
<br>
I work at the interface of people, organisations and technology - challenging the status quo, and pushing for improvements in all three.<br>
<br>
.END.<br>
<br>
I kept wanting to add stuff, which then needed more adding to make it meaningful, so have tried to keep it simple and open. I'd welcome any feedback though.</div><h1>Click <ul>here</ul> for usability advice</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 February 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>When you take exams, you're told to carefully read every question, and particularly the rubric at the beginning of the exam, which explains how the exam is going to work.<br>
<br>
Even then, people don't read the questions properly.<br>
<br>
When you're working on a screen it's even worse. According to people like <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/writing.html">Jacob Neilsen</a>, most people really don't read what's in front of them. Instead they scan, picking out individual words and sentences.<br>
<br>
As well as headings and bullets, users expect to be able to scan for links, and to be able to know quickly where those links will take them. It's a concept known as "scent".<br>
<br>
When we give them a link that just says "here", or even "click here", it contains no information or scent about where that link will take them. And because the user is scanning the page, they are unlikely to read the information to either side of the link which does explain it. Or if they do, it's only because they've had to.<br>
<br>
Your job, as an interface designer, is to make life easier for the user, and to remove barriers to usage. Forcing them to read where they would normally scan is unhelpful and inconsiderate.<br>
<br>
Instead of the "Click here" link, provide a link that is explicit about where the user will go, or what will happen. For example: "Continue reading", "More information", "Location map"<br>
<br>
For some designers, that's counter-intuitive, and can feel almost too abrupt or impolite. But actually it's the opposite. You are helping your users - and they will thank you for it.<br>
<br>
If you really want to design your websites and applications for usability, then get hold of <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don't Make Me Think</a>, by Steve Krug. It's one of the best books I know on the subject!</div><h1>Elevator Pitch - expanded</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 6 February 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Last week, I started thinking about my personal "<a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/01/28/my-elevator-pitch?blog=5">elevator pitch</a>".<br>
<br>
The short version is currently: <em>I work at the interface of people, organisations and technology - challenging the status quo, and pushing for improvements in all three.</em><br>
<br>
But that needs filling out, so here goes...<br>
<br>
It's important to have people who can act as a "translator" between IT people, learning &amp; development specialists, and organisation managers. That's where I tend to sit.<br>
<br>
<div class="image_block"><img alt="Elevator Pitch Venn diagram" src="./assets/elevator_pitch.png" width="500" height="500"></div><br>
<br>
It is primarily a communication role; preparing documents, articles, presentations, videos, workshops etc.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's <strong>proactive</strong> - trying to help create understanding, and sharing knowledge, between the different groups around things such as security, usability, learning theory and design, and change management. By necessity, this includes considerable amounts of research and reading to keep up to date with the changing environments.<br>
<br>
And sometimes it's <strong>reactive</strong>, responding to the needs of the different groups and ensuring that effective communication takes place between them. This can include project management,  requirements gathering, procurement support, sales support, supplier liaison, training and user support, and much more...<br>
<br>
I support these communication pathways across organisational boundaries - working with people from both internal &amp; external suppliers and customers (both prospective and current). Again, by necessity, this means working in multiple contexts, across the public, private and charity sectors, including formal and workplace education.<br>
<br>
That's why building and maintaining an effective network is essential to me, and why I subscribe wholeheartedly to a <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm">connectivist</a> approach to my own development.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><h3>Principles of connectivism</h3><br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions.</li><br>
  <li>Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources.</li><br>
  <li>Learning may reside in non-human appliances.</li><br>
  <li>Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known</li><br>
  <li>Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning.</li><br>
  <li>Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill.</li><br>
  <li>Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities.</li><br>
  <li>Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision.</li><br>
</ul><br>

</blockquote></div><h1>Who owns corporate social media?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 February 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>With many corporate systems now coming with in-built social media tools, and bottom-up systems like Yammer &amp; Socialcast gaining large numbers of users through exponential growth, who's job is it to prevent fragmentation of your internal social networks?<br>
<br>
It seems like every corporate tool now has some element of social media contained within it. <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/Pages/Features.aspx?Capability=Communities">Sharepoint 2010</a> comes with a range of community tools (blogs, ratings, tagging etc). <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> has integrated its fully-featured <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/uk/chatter/whatischatter/">Chatter</a> social collaboration and networking product. Oracle has got the "<a href="http://cloud.oracle.com/mycloud/f?p=service:social:0">Oracle Social Network</a>" product. Project management tools, such as <a href="http://www.huddle.com/">Huddle</a> have integrated social tools.  And every <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system">LMS</a> vendor in the world seems to think their product contains the ultimate in social learning tools.<br>
<br>
Alongside that, there are standalone commercial platforms like <a href="https://www.noddlepod.com/">NoddlePod</a> (worth a look just for a lesson in simplicity!), <a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>, <a href="http://www.socialcast.com/">Socialcast</a> and Fusion Universal's <a href="http://www.fusion-universal.com/products_services/fuse.php">Fuse</a>. And in the open-source world, we have <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a> and <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a>.<br>
<br>
Organisations are becoming more comfortable with the use of social media, and exploring its potential to improve the way the organisation runs. However, this now runs the risk of different parts of the organisation promoting their own particular networking or collaboration tool.<br>
<br>
In a typical organisation you might find the IT team promoting Sharepoint, business managers promoting Salesforce, Internal Communications promoting Yammer, Learning &amp; Development promoting <a href="http://www.saba.com/social-learning-software">Saba Social Learning</a>, HR promoting Oracle, and your R&amp;D mavericks promoting BuddyPress.<br>
<br>
Multiplying social networks causes fragmentation of different interest groups - which is bad news for anyone hoping to break down organisational silos.<br>
<br>
You could adopt a Darwinian approach and go for survival of the fittest - but that's not a quick route to change, and will potentially lead to a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race">space race</a>" between competing departments.<br>
<br>
My advice would be that there needs to be someone at the highest level taking responsibility, providing strategic leadership, working with system suppliers &amp; integrators, and pulling together social media expertise from across the organisation.</div><h1>Is this a better approach to face-to-face learning?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 February 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>With all the advances in online learning, why haven't we changed our approach to the face-to-face event?<br>
<br>
We now have ways to easily deliver content, whether text, images, audio, video (or any combination) using massively scalable technologies.<br>
<br>
Similarly, we can mix this with computer-marked activities and peer-to-peer communication and collaboration.<br>
<br>
With all this, why do we still need the classroom / conference hall?<br>
<br>
<a href="http://about.me/dajbelshaw">Doug Belshaw</a> puts it very nicely when he says:<br>
<blockquote><br>
The face-to-face nature of conferences is, I believe, of even more importance in an extremely digitally connected world. Whilst it’s often the case that you can get to know people very well online, there’s something about embodied interaction that makes your knowledge of that person three-dimensional.<br>
<p class="right"><a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/doug-belshaw/conferences-catalysts-educational-innovation-and-change">Conferences as Catalysts for Educational Innovation and Change</a></p><br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
When you're completely engaged by a great performance (whether in speaking, sport or music), being there is often a better experience than watching it later. Although, as <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED Talks</a> show, even second-hand is far better than nothing!<br>
<br>
However, most face-to-face learning experiences are not great performances. Most presentation style sessions, including my own, are distinctly mediocre when judged as performances, and, to be honest, not exactly memorable. Not really what you want when you're there to learn.<br>
<br>
What we often forget, is that the best learning often happens when you try to explain things to other people, or ask questions, or exchange points of view. In fact, when you have conversations.<br>
<br>
By provoking conversation, you are provoking the very thing that stimulates people to engage with the subject in question. If you have an expert in the room, that's even better. As they can ask the right questions, or feed in the right bits of information at just the right time.<br>
<br>
That's great when you've got small groups, but how does that work as group sizes go up? This is an important consideration if you're looking at learning models that work financially.<br>
<br>
One method is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)">Fishbowl technique</a>. This is a method of dialogue that works for large groups, whilst allowing all to participate.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can create a series of practical activities that learners will work through in groups. (This is the approach I'm going to take in next month's Elearning Network event: <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/events/getting-started-elearning">Getting started in elearning</a>)<br>
<br>
For longer face-to-face events, you'd use a mixture of different conversation techniques, with different sized groups, and different activities. But the thing to avoid is the presentation - unless of course you have an expert performer who can engage the audience.<br>
<br>
To help any conversation-based session to work well, you need a number of elements in place:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>A skilled moderator or facilitator who will provide the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolding</a> for the conversation, set timings, pull together arguments (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_tutoring">Online Tutoring article</a>) and not feel the need to take over the conversation.</li><br>
  <li>A subject matter expert who will provide input to the scaffolding resources, and act as a sounding board and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaching">coach</a> for learners (under the guidance of the facilitator)</li><br>
  <li>Conversation that is at the right level for the people in the room - ie. just beyond their comfort zone - inside their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone of Proximal Development</a>.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Remember, too, that your learner's experience of your workshop starts when they first see the advert, and finishes when they try the ideas out back at base. From start to finish, it's your responsibility as the organiser to make the workshop the most effective learning experience they can get. This may include <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2007/06/22/what_s_in_it_for_me?blog=5">setting expectations about pre-workshop activities</a> (eg. watching a video, reading an article). Just like the best teacher you had at school, you'll need to be consistent on those expectations. People will soon learn that they'll get the most from their experience with you if they meet them.<br>
<br>
It's all about making the best use of the environments (both online and face-to-face) you've got available to you.<br>

Should they remain? Should they be changed to accommodate the new?<br>
<br>
Online and informal learning is a case in point. For decades, learning (whether in schools, universities or the workplace) was based mainly around the classroom. There were occassional forays into self-directed or distance learning, but primarily all learning activity was focussed on the interaction between the "teacher" and the "learner" at a particular moment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime">space-time</a>.<br>
<br>
Until the late 1990's, the closest many people got to informal learning was browsing the books at home or at the library - both of which were limited in scope.<br>
<br>
Now, however, we have more information at our fingertips than we can handle. We have access to experts, pundits, friends and extremists in equal measure, from across the world. Lack of data is no longer an excuse.<br>
<br>
This knowledge economy is also democratized. Anyone, with even the simplest smartphone or cheapest computer, can add into the ever-expanding global knowledgebase.<br>
<br>
Yet our schools, universities and workplaces - the core, foundational structures of society - continue working as if nothing had changed.<br>
<br>
Our classrooms and lecture theatres are still designed as places where knowledge is imparted, and their curriculums as the sole source of that knowledge. Anyone that strays outside of the proscribed norms of behaviour or ability is a problem to be dealt with or ignored, rather than the individual they are.<br>
<br>
Our training departments and the dependency culture of learning they implicitly promote are unable to keep up with the pace of change, and run the risk of, at best, becoming irrelevant, or at worst, a barrier to development.<br>
<br>
Our work is done in isolation from other people doing similar things. The freedom of communication taken for granted across the internet is rarely replicated inside our workplaces, and often blocked on work equipment...<br>
<br>

<br>
If we were starting again, what would our learning institutions look like? What would be the essential skills, knowledge and behaviours that we would expect every school to develop? How would we organise (or allow?) learning inside our companies?<br>
<br>
Online learning has the potential to break down boundaries between organisations and between people, and to allow knowledge to flow easily between them. Outside of our societal structures this is already happening.<br>
<br>
Should we be seeking to make that potential a reality within our current model of schools, universities and workplace? Or do we need to rethink the very structures themselves, and look for alternative models of society that can make best use of the new knowledge networks?<br>

<h3>The problem</h3><br>
<p>The company has an integrated customer-relationship management (CRM) system, that was designed to improve efficiencies across all the functions, and to enable consistencies in communication.</p><br>
<p>However, the promised efficiences have not been realised.</p><br>
<p>The IT manager has investigated, and discovered that:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Some sales people are not using the CRM at all – preferring to work with their own spreadsheets</li><br>
<li>There is confusion amongst the customer-facing functions over what information should go into what fields</li><br>
<li>The quality of technical advice given to customers is varying, mainly because technicians are not documenting calls properly, and there is little aggregation of knowledge by team managers.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>Senior management have decided that Learning &amp; Development should be the team to solve this problem.</p><br>
<h3>Success criteria</h3><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Total spend (including travel &amp; subsistence) to be within the allocated budget</li><br>
<li>Time away from work for learning to be no more than 1 day per person, with no more than 1 hour in any working day.</li><br>
<li>The solution should be sustainable, with minimal ongoing input, to enable new starters to “get with the programme”</li><br>
<li>Efficiencies should be realised in both sales and front-office</li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>L&amp;D Culture</h3><br>
<p>Up to now, the company L&amp;D culture has been focussed on face-to-face, classroom-based training. Follow-up reviews indicate that much of the content is irrelevant and poorly presented. Also the training often takes place when the learner is least able to make use of it immediately.</p><br>
<p>The L&amp;D team has created some elearning materials (using a rapid development tool) around topics such as information security, data protection, diversity and health &amp; safety. Although most people have completed the training, it has had little noticeable impact on behaviours, and the general reaction has been that the elearning was boring and poorly presented.</p><br>
<p>Elearning is perceived as a poor substitute for attending a face-to-face course.</p><br>
<h3>Solution</h3><br>
<p>The L&amp;D team have developed a programme which comprises:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Ongoing identification of CRM best practices through a limited number of CRM champions from across the business</li><br>
<li>Procuring a series of short, 3 minute videos which highlight the benefits of the CRM system, and focus on specific, centrally-affirmed best practices. These will be hosted in an off-site video-delivery system, with access only for XYZ staff on XYZ hardware.</li><br>
<li>Quarterly face-to-face workshops for CRM champions to raise issues, share best practice and create new resources.</li><br>
<li>A hints and tips hashtag for CRM champions (and other users) to share their knowledge on the company’s micro-blogging system</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>They know that, for the programme to succeed, initial and ongoing learner engagement is critical.</p><br>
<p>Your team has been brought in as consultants to help with this...</p><br>
<h3>Encouraging Engagement</h3><br>
[You will be discussing these questions in small groups on the day - but feel free to comment back on this post for clarification or to test out ideas]<br>
<ol><br>
<li>What problems can you forsee with gaining and sustaining learner engagement in this programme?<br> Hint: Consider access, motivation, communication and management</li><br>
<li>What elements would you like to see within the <strong>design</strong> of the videos or the delivery system that would specifically encourage engagement?<br> Hint: Consider the characteristics of Youtube videos that achieve high engagement, eg. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VaPOtC-Ans">usefulness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA">quirkyness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ5dbUCu2Ug">comedy</a>. Also consider what gets and keeps people engaged with long term programmes such as video games, TV drama serials, sporting leagues.</li><br>
<li>What should go into the <strong>communication</strong> plan for this programme?<br> Hint: Think about communications in four stages:<br><br>
Well in advance of start -&gt; Just before it starts -&gt; During -&gt; After<br></li><br>
<li>What specific <strong>management</strong> practices would encourage engagement?</li><br>

<br>
Outside of these structures, we can see new technologies breaking down the boundaries between organisations and people, providing ready access to information, and democratizing the knowledge economy. Inside them, much is the same as it has been since the start of the industrial revolution - with hierarchies and control to the fore.<br>
<br>
Responding to a <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/03/14/new-wine-old-wineskins?blog=5#c3471">follow-up comment</a>, I wrote:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
How many schools have changed the way they use their classrooms, because of what can now be achieved through online methods? How many have changed their teachers' contracts to allow them to work from home? How many are accepting students on a more flexible basis? How many schools still close down all operations when there's a bit of snow?<br>
<br>
In the workplace, it's more common to find organisations blocking the very tools that are used outside for learning, than embracing them. Until cooperation and communication finds a place at the heart of the work we do, organisations will remain reliant on centrally-driven elearning programmes that simply reinforce the status quo. By so doing, these organisations will continue to lag behind in a business and cultural environment that is changing far more rapidly than they can.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
You <strong>can</strong> find examples of institutions and workplaces where the potential has been seen by visionary leaders; where the boundaries of the underpinning organisational structures themselves are pushed, and occasionally completely reformed.<br>
<br>
I have worked with schools where teachers' contracts were re-written, to allow them to support city-wide live online learning sessions from home. Thus enabling sharing of resources between schools.<br>
<br>
Other schools, eg. <a href="http://www.hollinsclough.staffs.sch.uk/Flexi.htm">Hollinsclough Primary School</a> are providing flexible schooling - working in partnership with home-schooling parents from across local authority boundaries. They are leading the way in showing how pooled resources can help small schools <strong>and</strong> home-schooling to remain viable.<br>
<br>
Some teachers, schools, and sometimes even whole local authorities (US: school boards) are exploring different models of learning, where classroom time is seen as too valuable to devote to one-size-fits-all lock-step teaching. Instead it's used for conversation, problem-solving, peer support. The teacher's role becomes that of a facilitator, coach and guide. How else can we manage increasing class sizes and diverse student populations? Who says that every hour of a student's time in school has to be spent in a classroom with a teacher? Why not build managed self-study into the timetable, thus allowing classroom time to have a better student:teacher ratio?<br>
<br>
Some workplaces are taking the best of what happens on the real-world internet, and bringing it in-house. Deloitte's use of Yammer (a Facebook/Twitter-like tool - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn4Bz8Bm4Fw">discussed in this video by its CEO</a>) has been a catalyst to breaking down hierarchies - but with real business benefits. <a href="http://learningwiki.editme.com/322">Cash America's use of user-generated video content</a> has provided a simple, but effective means of upskilling front-line staff. Software developed under collaborative, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> models now <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2011/06/07/june-2011-web-server-survey.html">drives the majority of the world's web servers</a>, powers <a href="http://moodle.org/stats/">thousands of learning institutions' online learning functions</a>. Open source, collaborative development has also begun to take shape in the real world, with "distributed DIY projects" (see video below).<br>
<br>
But these are just the outworkings of a new model.<br>
<br>
What sits behind them is a sea change in how we deal with people. Rather than hierarchies and control, the underlying principles of this new paradigm are contribution and trust - leading to self-organisation (discussed and demonstrated brilliantly by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8MwyJH8Zo">Sugata Mitra at ALT 2010 (Youtube)</a><br>

</object></div><h1>What's the impact of L&amp;D?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 March 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>At the #elnevent yesterday, one of the key points that kept coming out was the need for L&amp;D departments to be able to articulate their value proposition.<br>
<br>
ie. L&amp;D people need to be able to communicate what value they are offering to their organisations.<br>
<br>
At it's simplest, they must be able to explain to senior stakeholders what the impact would be if L&amp;D stopped working...<br>
<br>
For most functional departments this is quite easy. It's easy to imagine the impact if IT, Sales, or even HR stopped doing their work.<br>
<br>
But L&amp;D is a bit less definable. Perhaps that's because the impact on the organisation is not immediately visible?<br>
<br>
Think about the impact L&amp;D has had on you. In my case, it's very little. If I need to learn something, I'll learn it.<br>
<br>
Now, think about what would happen if the L&amp;D department shut up shop and said no more courses. What would be the short, medium and long term effects to your organisation?<br>
<br>
What real value are you offering to solve real problems?</div><h1>Is SCORM a barrier to learning?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 27 March 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Short answer: No, but the way we use it might be.<br>
<br>
Long answer:<br>
<br>
First of all, let's just remind ourselves what SCORM is, and what it's for...<br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model">SCORM</a> (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) is a collection of ideas that describes how to put "Content Objects" together in a way that they can be reused (Shared) across multiple, different systems.<br>
<br>
These ideas cover:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>How to describe such content with metadata</li><br>
  <li>How the content should be bundled together into a single package</li><br>
  <li>How the content should talk to the receiving system</li><br>
  <li>How the content should be sequenced to other pieces of content</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
In corporate learning, (1) and (4) are very rarely used - because they're pretty complicated, which leaves us with very little of use.<br>
<br>
The SCORM bundling process takes something very simple (putting files into a zip package) and adds an unnecessary layer of complexity by requiring an XML file which describes the contents of the zip package. If we were using SCORM as was intended, we would be breaking our content down into component parts which would make use of the XML file. But usually we don't.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the data transfer between content object and receiving system is usually limited to simple end-of-unit test scores and progress information. How often this is for the benefit of the learner is questionable. SCORM is capable of much more in terms of data transfer, but it's rarely used, often because you start to lose the ability to move content between systems easily.<br>
<br>
<h3>Comparison with the real world</h3><br>
<br>
Outside of corporate learning very few people will have ever heard of SCORM. Yet many people will have used learning content delivery systems such as Youtube, Scribd, Slideshare and Flickr.<br>
<br>
All of these take learning content in a particular packaged format and deliver it in the most efficient way possible to the end user.<br>
<br>
But these platforms do so much more than we get from our corporate learning systems:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>The content is embedded in the platform, not separate to it (although learners can choose to make the content operate in the whole screen - choice is the key here)</li><br>
  <li>Therefore the learner always has access to the platform's functionality when they're using the content.</li><br>
  <li>Around the content, the platform wraps social elements such as comments, ratings, and social media links.</li><br>
  <li>It also displays metrics such as aggregate ratings and viewing numbers.</li><br>
  <li>The platform displays other, related content items, based on the metadata and the way other users have behaved.</li><br>
  <li>The platforms allow users to engage with the content, again through comments, and through adding to personal "playlists" or "favourites".</li><br>
  <li>The platforms, in some cases, allow users to enhance the content, through the addition of layers containing links and explanatory text.</li><br>
  <li>The platforms allow users to embed the content in their own websites - the ultimate in shareable content.</li><br>
  <li>The platforms put "search" at the centre of their user-experience. By exposing as much content as possible to the search engines, they make the content more useful.</li><br>
</ul><br>
All these are for the benefit of the end-user. If they weren't they wouldn't get used, and no-one would publish content to them.<br>
<br>
In contrast, how do we use SCORM packages?<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>We hide content from search engines, and only allow users to search by metadata (if there is any)</li><br>
  <li>We treat the platform as secondary to the content, and ignore the user experience of getting to, from and between the content packages.</li><br>
  <li>We treat learners as if they are in isolation from each other while they're using the content, and forget the social elements of learning.</li><br>
  <li>We take away anything that will help learners exercise choice (a key element in self-motivated learning), whether that's cues to help them choose (eg. ratings and usage figures), or how they will use the content (eg. full screen, no ability to bookmark in their browser, and, often, no ability to cut and paste)</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
SCORM isn't necessarily the villain, but it does add a layer of complexity, which is beyond most L&amp;D teams to embrace fully.<br>
<br>
For most current corporate elearning, we could easily get by without using SCORM, if our systems allowed it. The ideal, of course, would be for our systems to be able to accept multiple content types (including SCORM) and display them all in a consistent user-centred way, like Slideshare, Youtube etc. It's all learning content, so why is SCORM seen as something that's special and different?<br>

That's true whether you're a learning intervention designer (including online, print and face-to-face), or whether you're a learning systems designer.<br>
<br>
A great model I recently discovered (after a talk with <a href="http://www.ht2.co.uk/ben/">Ben Betts</a>) is the <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">User Experience Honeycomb</a> from <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/about/">Peter Morville</a>.<br>
<br>
Within it, he describes seven facets of user experience:<br>
<blockquote><br>
<ul><br>
<li><strong>Useful.</strong> As practitioners, we can't be content to paint within the lines drawn by managers.  We must have the courage and creativity to ask whether our products and systems are useful, and to apply our deep knowledge of craft and medium to define innovative solutions that are more useful.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Usable.</strong> Ease of use remains vital, and yet the interface-centered methods and perspectives of human-computer interaction do not address all dimensions of web design.  In short, usability is necessary but not sufficient.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Desirable.</strong> Our quest for efficiency must be tempered by an appreciation for the power and value of image, identity, brand, and other elements of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465051359/">emotional design</a>.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Findable.</strong> We must strive to design navigable web sites and locatable objects, so users can find what they need.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Accessible.</strong> Just as our buildings have elevators and ramps, our web sites should be accessible to people with disabilities (more than 10% of the population).  Today, it's <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/reference/web_standards_for_business.html">good business</a> and the ethical thing to do.  Eventually, it will become the law.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Credible.</strong> Thanks to the <a href="http://credibility.stanford.edu/">Web Credibility Project</a>, we're beginning to understand the design elements that influence whether users trust and believe what we tell them.</li><br>
 <br>
<li><strong>Valuable.</strong> Our sites must deliver value to our sponsors. For non-profits, the user experience must advance the mission.  With for-profits, it must contribute to the bottom line and improve customer satisfaction.</li><br>

<br>
Thanks to my friends at <a href="http://www.getabstract.com/en/">Get Abstract</a>, I got an invitation to attend yesterday's <a href="http://www.benchmarkforbusiness.com/a-conversation-with-charles-handy/">Conversation with Charles Handy</a> conference.<br>
<br>
This was my first experience of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Handy">Charles Handy</a>, although I'd been aware of his reputation as a "management guru" for a while. I do tend to be a bit wary of anyone known as a guru, but in this case I was very pleasantly surprised.<br>
<br>
The first surprise was that 'conversation' really did mean conversation. I've been <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/02/07/is-this-a-better-approach?blog=5">rattling on for a long time</a> about events that are no more than presentations being a massive waste of time and money. Learning or behaviour change is far more likely to happen when people participate and engage. Conversations rather than presentations should be the order of the day.<br>
<br>
And that's exactly what happened. In each of the four sessions, Charles spoke for a short time, giving some key points, and telling stories. Then he set us a question to consider on our tables. After a while, he opened up the conversation by inviting people to join him on the stage. There was always an empty, third chair on the stage, this allowing a new person to pick up the conversation.<br>
<br>
It was a little like the fishbowl method I've previously discussed, but on a smaller scale.<br>
<br>
And it felt really effective. As the day went on (and I missed the afternoon so I'm extrapolating a little here), people became more confident and prepared to contribute. By sharing their experiences, it gave the discussion a context, and a dose of reality.<br>
<br>
I'll pick up the content of the two sessions I attended in a couple of follow-up posts on 'The future of capitalism' and 'The changing workplace and workforce'.</div><h1>Handy: The changing workplace and workforce</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 April 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>#handy2012<br>
<br>
One of the sessions at the recent Charles Handy conference was on the topic of "the changing workplace and workforce".<br>
<br>
There was nothing majorly new in the content of what was discussed, but it did bring to a head of few topics that I've been pondering on for a while.<br>
<br>
Here's a taster of my notes from the session:<br>
<br>
<h3>On work</h3><br>
<br>
The people inside organisations are the holders of the intellectual property (IP).<br>
<br>
The organisations simply bribe those people to keep the IP inside the organisation.<br>
<br>
Living as a "flea" (an independent contractor) is becoming more popular. In the US now, about 27% of the workforce are fleas.<br>
<br>
Life as a flea is more uncertain, but who would really want to be employed?<br>
<br>
But fleas need "elephants" (large organisations) who will employ them.<br>
<br>
Employing organisations should think of their buildings more like club-houses, with different spaces for meeting, socialising and working. Perhaps something like the <a href="http://www.iod.com/home/premises/london---pall-mall/default.aspx">Institute of Directors building in Pall Mall</a><br>
<br>
If you have a talent, nobody asks your age.<br>
<br>
This is vitally important as state pensions, private pensions and savings become worth less.<br>
<br>
Paid work in "retirement" is increasingly important.<br>
<br>
"Sensible people reinvent themselves every 10 years."<br>
<br>
We should consider a portfolio life, that contains different clients and different kinds of work (paid, gift, study and home) in order to maintain flexibility and to provide resilience in hard times. The balance between the kinds of work changes over time.<br>
<br>
<h3>On education</h3><br>
<br>
Quoted <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm">Howard Gardner</a> (who I came across years ago, but put in the same bucket as all the other learning style theories - ie. discredited). My thoughts: Looks like it might still be a useful framework - as long as we don't treat it as a means of labelling children.<br>
<br>
Schools should exist to identify what a child is good at (from across all the different "intelligences").<br>
<br>
But schools are constrained by exams and the curriculum.<br>
<br>
The greatest gift you can give to a child is telling them what they're good at.</div><h1>How do you know if your web application is out of date?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 April 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Doing a quick comparison of modern SAAS applications such as Google Docs and Salesforce with your typical corporate, browser-based application reveals some key indicators about whether you may need to update:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Does your application only work in one make of browser? How is that sustainable when the trend is towards people bringing their own devices?</li><br>
<li>Does your application say it works best in a particular screen resolution? You're missing a trick if mobile access doesn't play a part in your application strategy.</li><br>
<li>Does your application require ActiveX controls, or similar plugins, to work? Apart from making it browser dependant, this is a sign of out-of-date coding, when, with a modern browser, some JavaScript and CSS, there's little that can't be done. (The obvious exceptions are communication and desktop sharing tools which rely on the plugins to make best use of the available bandwidth and to interact with operating system elements outside of the browser.)</li><br>
<li>Does your application force users to learn an interface that runs counter to accepted web conventions? Apart from being inefficient, this sends the message that we don't care about our users.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Do these sound familiar?</div><h1>Twitter: do's and don'ts</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 24 April 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>It took me a while to understand Twitter. <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/02/26/coping-with-twitter?blog=5">I spent a long time taking the view that it was an addictive waste of time and pretty useless for in-depth conversations.</a><br>

I realise now that I hadn't grasped when Twitter should and shouldn't be used, and how to get the best out of it.<br>

The following two lists are based on my experiences. I'd love to hear from others too.<br>

<ul><br>
  <li>Do treat Twitter like your work kitchen, water cooler or staff room. You wouldn't spend all day there, and you wouldn't expect to be aware of every conversation taking place while you weren't there.</li><br>
 <li>Do dip in every now and again. Have a quick look at what people are talking about.</li><br>
  <li>Do consider replying to someone if they have said something useful, interesting or stimulating. If there's nothing there of interest to you, then post about something that you've discovered, thought about or found infuriating. It might start a conversation.</li><br>
  <li>Do make sure your Twitter profile says something about who you are and what you might tweet about, so people know why they might follow you.</li><br>
  <li>Do follow people you find interesting. It's the equivalent of having people at work that you enjoy hanging out with in the staff room.</li><br>
  <li>Do add a picture of yourself to your profile. It gives your Tweets a human face. This is true even if you're Tweeting as part of work.</li><br>
  <li>Do take a break completely from Twitter for a few days. It'll do you good. Real conversations and thinking need more than 140 characters.</li><br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h3>Don't</h3><br>
<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Don't be afraid to dip out of a conversation. If someone wants to talk to you directly, they'll mention you in a post and you'll be able to reply later.</li><br>
  <li>Don't tell us everything that's happening in your life. It gets a little boring.</li><br>
  <li>Don't be afraid to unfollow people if what they are saying gets boring or irrelevant to you at the moment. It's not personal...</li><br>
  <li>Don't just post links to your company website. I'm sure you're more interesting than that.</li><br>
  <li>Don't try to read over every conversation that's happened in the past 24 hours. Just focus on the stuff happening now.</li><br>
  <li>Don't use Twitter to replace reading blogs, journals and newspapers regularly. It's where the deep thinking is taking place. You do have an RSS reader don't you?</li><br>

<br>
Via: <a href="http://www.aconventional.com/2012/05/e-learning-is-dead-long-live-online.html">Nick Shackleton-Jones' challenging post on the future of online learning</a>, where he draws a parallel between elearning and the fax machine:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>there will still be times when we need to use it, but the days when it seemed ubiquitous and something everyone needed to have are over. The demise of both have similar roots: overtaken by a flurry of smaller, more agile technologies.</blockquote></div><h1>Creativity, problem finding, education and training</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 8 May 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>A small crowd of teenagers were gathered in the quiet computer room on a Wednesday afternoon. They watched in astonishment as, on a small square monitor screen appeared a rapid succession of numbers - prime numbers - those numbers that can only be divided by one or itself. To work out such a large sequence manually would have taken hours of painstaking, boring work with a calculator.<br>
<br>
"How did you do that?" they asked of the young man with the mass of curly light brown hair who was operating the computer. He explained his method, which involved visualising a vast quantity of "pots", one for each integer to be tested - up to 1000, 10 000, or as high as the computer had memory to store.<br>
<br>
"Start with the small prime numbers, the ones that we know already, like 1, 2 and 3", he stated. "Miss out 1, but, starting with 2, put a marker in the pots that are multiples of 2. That's an easy set of calculations: 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 etc. Then do the same with 3: 3x2, 3x3, 3x4 etc.<br>
<br>
"What's the next pot without a marker? Five. So that's a prime. So, do the same thing with that; put markers in 5x2, 5x3 etc. And the next one? Seven. Same again.<br>
<br>
"You keep going until your halfway to your maximum number. After that there's no point, because any number that's left unmarked times 2 will be bigger than your maximum.<br>
<br>
"At that point, all the pots that don't have markers will be prime numbers. So, it's just a case of running off a list of those numbers."<br>
<br>
It was a simple concept, made possible by a combination of the speed of calculations on the computer and the imagination of the person writing the programme.<br>
<br>
After the demonstration, the rest of the group dispersed to their respective computers; to try it out for themselves, to make their game of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snakegame.org.uk/" target="_blank">Snakes</a> run just that little bit faster, or to debug the code they'd spent hours copying in from a magazine.<br>
<br>
It was the early 1980's. Micro-computers were just finding their ways into schools, and most teachers (like now) did not have the time or the interest to understand them, or their potential.<br>
<br>
We were left to our own devices and quickly discovered how to control these new machines; to model real and abstract situations from physics, and applied and pure maths, to create games, and to play them. Nothing was networked, or attached to sensors or motors. It was just you, your imagination, and the programme.<br>
<br>
But we weren't on our own. Some of us grasped some concepts quicker than others, and then demonstrated and explained. Some bought magazines that introduced new ideas. Some went to shows and came back with stories of 16kB RAM packs and 1.2MB floppy disk drives...<br>
<br>

<p>ZX81 with RAM pack and printer - Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ZX81_-_rampack_-_ZX_Printer.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p></div><br>
<br>
As a group we learnt together, but independent of any formal curriculum, and with no support from anyone that you'd recognise as a teacher.<br>
<br>
We learnt programming concepts, like loops and procedures. We learnt to be ultra-careful with syntax, to use error messages to help troubleshooting, and to write code together to catch problems quickly.<br>
<br>
We learnt about operating systems, directories and files. We learnt that programming with variables meant we could change the way our code behaved by simply changing a handful of settings. We learnt the principles of using one chunk of code many times.<br>
<br>
Time moves on, and nearly 30 years later, as I watch my son using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, I see him learning in the same way. No-one is teaching him, but through a combination of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=minecraft&amp;search=tag" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki" target="_blank">Minecraft wiki</a>, discussing with friends, asking questions, and trial and error he is learning to:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<li>build virtual worlds with machines and habitats</li><br>
<li>manipulate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Texture_Packs" target="_blank">complex graphics files</a> to change the look and feel of the worlds and their characters</li><br>
<li>navigate the MacOS directory structure to find the locations for the various graphics files</li><br>
<li>create and unpack zip archives</li><br>
<li>pack and unpack .jar files to add in code modifications</li><br>
<li>search for and find answers to problems in forum postings</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/73368-how-to-remove-mods-on-a-mac/" target="_blank">deal with mods that crash&nbsp;Minecraft</a></li><br>
<li>manage a Minecraft server, with its security implications</li><br>
<li>manage a Virtual Private Network (<a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/" target="_blank">Hamachi</a>) so he and his friends can work in the same world</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
In a similar way to the skills we gained on those Wednesday afternoons, my son and his peers are doing more than unwittingly teaching themselves computer science. They are developing wider thinking and problem-solving skills within a context of sharing, cooperation, peer feedback and self motivated challenges.<br>
<br>
What can we learn as teaching and learning professionals from these two examples?<br>
<br>
The key is to stop doing the learning for the student. According to Ewan McIntosh, we spend too much of our professional time trying to find ways to shortcut the learning process, which then simply short changes our learners. They become dependent on the professional, and gradually less capable of independent creative thought.<br>
<br>
Instead, our job should be one that encourages learners to&nbsp;<a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2012/01/design-thinking-2-immersion-dont-give-students-a-problem-to-solve.html" target="_blank"><strong>immerse</strong></a> themselves in the problems that surround them, helps them to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.matthewholloway.com/synthesis.html" target="_blank"><strong>synthesise</strong></a> the key information relevant to the challenges into connected ideas, facilitates&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking#Ideation" target="_blank"><strong>ideation</strong></a> (the process of generating and collecting ideas), and provides tools and materials that will help them to&nbsp;<a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2010/10/design-thinking-solves-real-problems.html" target="_blank"><strong>prototype</strong></a> solutions.<br>
<br>
The two videos below, both by&nbsp;<a href="http://edu.blogs.com/" target="_blank">Ewan McIntosh</a>, discuss the situation we're currently in, and proposes a solution that is working now around the globe. The solution is called "Design Thinking", a process which encompasses the four components mentioned above: immersion, synthesis, ideation and prototyping.<br>
<br>
Yes, it will probably take longer if we let learners spend their time immersing themselves in the problem and all its angles rather than spoon-feeding them the specific parts that the curriculum / training objectives dictate. But don't the benefits of developing self-sustaining, creative problem solvers outweigh that? (Perhaps not if you own a factory, or its modern day, data-processing centre equivalent... or am I simply being unnecessarily cynical?)<br>

<br>
Life has been a little busy around here. Buying a house and changing jobs at the same time!<br>
<br>
Yes, that's right... after nearly 12 years working for <a href="http://www.capita.co.uk/">Capita</a>, in various guises, I'm at last making the jump to something new...<br>
<br>
Before I get onto what I'll be doing, I thought it would be useful to make a note of a few of the many things I've learnt over the last twelve years, since leaving the world of teaching.<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Learning how to do my job is no-one's responsibility but mine. If I can't do the job, then it's up to me to find out how to improve.</li><br>
  <li>My worldwide network of peers (some known, some unknown) is one of the best sources of knowledge available - especially when you're working in an area which has no in-house expertise.</li><br>
  <li>A management culture that is based on trust and accountability works.</li><br>
  <li>Online groups only work well when either a) everyone in the group is totally committed to it or b) there is a critical mass of people with enough in the core to keep feeding the group.</li><br>
  <li>The usability of corporate IT systems will almost always fall behind consumer-grade systems because the people doing the buying are not the people using the systems.</li><br>
  <li>An <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/09/26/how-to-sell-software?blog=5">open approach to marketing software</a> is a key driver towards greater usability - as the end-users can have more impact on the buying process.</li><br>
  <li>My blog has become (to me) an increasingly valuable repository of information and thinking. Far more useful than the scrattly bits of paper that I make notes on...</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
And so, to the future...<br>
<br>
I will be working within the <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/">Xyleme</a> team, as a Customer Account Manager, helping their UK clients to get the most value from their Xyleme platform. It'll be exciting, as some of the time I'll be working with big name corporations. At other times I'll be back in the education world - helping large learning providers with lots of content to deploy.<br>
<br>
Xyleme is one of the world's leading learning content management system suppliers, and at the forefront of enabling XML-based, single-source publishing, to multiple platforms, in multiple contexts.<br>
<br>
I'll be delivering this contract from within my own learning technology consultancy company (<a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/">Wyver Solutions Ltd</a>). As work on this, and other contracts grows I'll be looking for associates to work with me. If that's you, <a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/contact-us/">please get in touch</a>.<br>
<br>
There's already one downside that I've noticed to the move... Speaking engagements, which conference organisers were quite happy to give me when I worked at <a href="http://www.capita-ld.co.uk/">Capita L&amp;D</a> (a supplier), have now, for some inexplicable reason, been withdrawn now that I'll be working for Xyleme. I'm still the same person, with the same ideas. For some reason, people seem to think that I'm now going to be in all-out sales mode... Not my style at all...<br>
<br>
Some things will stay the same though. This blog is going to remain my main thinking space. And I'll still be around on Twitter et al - possibly even more so now.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for the next chapter...</div><h1>The future of capitalism?</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 July 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>You'd think, given the immense problems seen with capitalism over the past few years, that more people would be up in arms about how our corporate institutions deal with people.<br>
<br>
I won't pretend to understand very much about how capitalism works, or even much about economics. But I am interested in the beliefs that underpin how our society works, and the effects on society when those beliefs are allowed to work through to their full extent.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/04/18/reflections-on-a-conversation-with?blog=5">Charles Handy's conversation session</a> about the Future of Capitalism opened up a few points that left me thinking..., particularly as <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/06/28/all-change?blog=5">I'm now in the market for a private pension</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm starting to realise that all the options available for investment in a pension are based on market-values; whether it's the current price of the Euro, of gold, or of the price of the shares in a particular company.<br>
<br>
When you "invest" in these, you're not actually making an investment in the thing itself. This particularly applies to company shares. The money invested in them doesn't go to the company to enable it to grow (except in the case of the initial offer of shares). Instead, you're just making a statement of confidence in the thing you're investing in.<br>
<br>
Pension funds (one of the main drivers of capitalist thinking and behaviours), through their share ownership, gain a role in the governance of companies, but none of the money invested in the pension actually goes to the company itself.<br>
<br>
There must be some benefits to this disconnect, but I'm not sure I understand them yet.<br>
<br>
It does seem that the whole pensions market is just a bit of a gamble, all based on how people "feel" about the market, rather than about genuine economic growth.<br>
<br>
It would be so much better, in my opinion, if I could invest my pension in schemes or programmes where the money could be used to stimulate growth, to make real products, or generate real benefits for people. For example, personal-lending programmes like (<a href="http://uk.zopa.com/">Zopa</a> and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding Circle</a>).<br>
<br>
But that's against the pension rules. I think because the HMRC want some level of independent governance that prevents fraudulent tax avoidance. I'm all for that, but there must be a way to make real pension investments that aren't just dependent on the movements of a market value?<br>
<br>
Any ideas?</div><h1>Tips for a social organisation</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 July 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>With more organisations beginning to adopt social media as part of their daily work practices, it's important to pick up on some of the lessons learned from social media use out in the "real world"...<br>
<br>
<h3>Have a human face</h3><br>
<br>
When you're working in a virtual organisation, where face-to-face contact is rare, it's really important to have a photo on your profile. We humans react to faces from birth. Without an image of the person to hang a conversation on, all you have is words, and sometimes voice.<br>
<br>
See: <a href="http://topdogsocialmedia.com/successful-social-media-profile-picture/">5 elements of a successful social media profile picture</a><br>
<br>
<h3>Fill in your profile</h3><br>
<br>
Social media is often not actually that social. When you meet people face-to-face, a lot of the time is spent exploring points of commonality: where do you live, which school/university did you go to, who have you worked for, did you read such and such.<br>
<br>
It's these little things that help to build a lasting working relationship.<br>
<br>
Online, there's rarely the time for such chit chat. So we have to pre-empt it by giving out information up front.<br>
<br>
Out in the real world, I try to have just one or two places where my profile (the things I want people to know about me) is kept up to date. At the moment, that's primarily LinkedIn. Every other profile I fill in just links back to that.<br>
<br>
If you don't have a public profile yet, it's still important to have one within your work social media system. Choose a place you can link to easily, and put in as much detail as you can to help people gain a picture of who you are.<br>
<br>
<h3>Narrate your work</h3><br>
<br>
Many social media systems contain an ongoing status update page, where everything that's done in the system is exposed to the rest of the community. Usually you can filter this down to just the projects or people you're interested in.<br>
<br>
But that only covers the changes or updates the systems picks up automatically. It won't pick up the things that you're thinking about, or trying out. All this is important too.<br>
<br>
As Andrew McAfee says:<br>
<blockquote>Talk both about work in progress (the projects you're in the middle of, how they're coming, what you're learning, and so on), and finished goods (the projects, reports, presentations, etc. you've executed). This lets others discover what you know and what you're good at. It also makes you easier to find, and so increases the chances you can be a helpful colleague to someone. Finally, it builds your personal reputation and 'brand.'<br>

</blockquote><br>
<br>
See: <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html">Narrate your work</a><br>
<br>
<h3>Make comments and links</h3><br>
<br>
Networks die when there are no connections being made. As new people enter the organisation, or new pieces of content get added, pull them into the network by linking to them and adding comments to the content. A strong network is one where links are constantly being made and refreshed.<br>
<br>
See <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm">George Siemen's seminal article on Connectivism</a><br>
<br>
<h3>Ask for help</h3><br>
<br>
It's OK not to know everything. In fact it's impossible to know everything. By asking for help you are giving yourself a learning opportunity, and also giving other people the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a public place.<br>
<br>
These days, giving away your knowledge is one of the best ways of ensuring your place in the network (and hopefully your future in the organisation!)<br>
<br>
<h3>Note</h3><br>
<br>
This article started off being all my own work, but, on finding Andrew McAfee's Harvard Business Review article, it turns out that I'm using many of his ideas! So, if you want more on this, go to the source: <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/mcafee/2010/09/dos-and-donts-for-your-works-s.html">http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/mcafee/2010/09/dos-and-donts-for-your-works-s.html</a></div><h1>Rapid Social Learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 19 July 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>One of the main reasons people give to avoid using online social networking tools at work is lack of time. This post gives four ways you can play a part in your organisation's learning network, without requiring much time to do so. In fact, some of them may even save you time!<br>
<br>
<h3>Use the tools provided to increase your speed</h3><br>
<br>
As you're looking things up and learning stuff, you'll find items that would be useful to your colleagues. Many social applications come with bookmarklets, or small programmes that let you quickly post a link. In my case, I use <a href="https://bitly.com/a/tools">bit.ly</a> to easily post links to Twitter. Two clicks and it's done.<br>
<br>
You can do the same with extensions in Chrome or Firefox. It's even easier on mobile devices, which have social integration at their heart.<br>
<br>
<h3>Feed your posts to the right people</h3><br>
<br>
If you're using <a href="http://blog.yammer.com/blog/2009/03/yammer-integrates-with-twitter.html">Yammer</a> or similar applications, they often come with a means of automatically filtering your Twitter posts, and pulling them into the organisation's internal social network. This is great if you have an organisation where people are less likely to be on Twitter, but are happy to use the internal tools.<br>
<br>
<h3>Build connections, and exploit them (nicely)</h3><br>
<br>
Once you've got a network of people you follow, and people who follow you, then start using it to ask questions. You'll find that those questions will quickly fly around the organisation, and you'll get answers from people a number of network connections away from you. This is especially true if you find those people who act as the hubs on your social network. They won't have the answers, but they will have the connections to get those answer. (See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network#Properties_of_small-world_networks">Wikipedia - properties of small world networks</a>)<br>
<br>
<h3>Stop answering the same question many times</h3><br>
<br>
If you've answered a question by email, then that knowledge only exists between you and the recipients. If you answer it on a blog, on in a video post, then that knowledge is made available to the rest of the organisation. If the same question comes back to you, then you can easily point people towards the answer.</div><h1>Credit for the term Learning Conversations</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 27 July 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Quite out of the blue this week, I received a comment on <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/06/courses-and-content?blog=5">one of my posts</a>, from <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/laurie-thomas/13/807/8aa">Prof Laurie Thomas</a> (if I've got the LinkedIn link to the wrong person, let me know!)<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I wonder whether you have identified the source of the scientific term "Learning_Conversations" <br>
<br>
If not let me point you towards our books - "Learning Conversations:- The Self-Organised Learning Way to Personal and Organisational Growth" Published by ROUTLEDGE 1991<br>
"Self-Organised Learning:- Foundations of a Conversational Science for Psychology" 1985<br>
and<br>
"Learning to change" in the McGraw-Hill Training Series 1995 there are over 40 Ph.D theses in Brunel University Library which all contributed to the development of S-O-L and Learning Conversations. It seems a pity that you are unable to acknowledge this resource. Or if you do. We would welcome more explicit acknowledgement. Or find you own terminology, rather than debasing ours. Thank you!<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
I hadn't realised that Learning Conversations was a "scientific term", although it doesn't surprise me that someone's used it as a term to describe a process in an academic research context. Given that I don't have access to academic libraries, it's not surprising that I failed to pick this up...<br>
<br>
I hope this post provides the explicit acknowledgment Prof. Thomas is looking for.<br>
<br>
I also hope that my use of the term Learning Conversation as a website name, and in my ongoing discussion of the use of conversations to support learning, does not debase too much the work Prof. Thomas and his colleagues have carried out.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a copy of the books referenced above, I'd be interested to read them. They appear to be out of print.</div><h1>Planning for scale</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 2 August 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><div class="image_block" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10 10;"><img alt="Construction" src="./assets/construction_200.jpg" width="200" height="267"></div>How easy is it for your organisation to scale its activities up (or down)?<br>
<br>
As you add new customers, what will be the impact on you? Does each new customer come with a massive overhead, or can you add them in with little additional effort?<br>
<br>
You need to ask yourselves these questions whatever service you provide - whether it's learning &amp; development delivery, software, support etc.<br>
<br>
It's very easy to say, "We're small", and not build the scaleability in at the beginning. But if you think that, then you'll either stay small, or you will find it very difficult to grow without significant, difficult changes.<br>
<br>
Let's look at some of the things larger organisations do that help them cope with the size of their operation:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li><strong>Depersonalised workforce</strong> - You'll rarely see an individual's email address when you deal with large organisations. Instead you get generic addresses and phone numbers that then allow the organisation to flex their numbers up and down as required.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Personalised customer service</strong> - to allow organisations to provide a personalised service, from a depersonalised workforce, you need to keep your customer information in one place, so that any customer-facing employee can get to it as needed.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Modularise</strong> - whether it's software or organisational functions, the more tightly defined each part is, the more flexible it becomes.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Connected</strong> - Modularisation brings disconnection, so large organisations try to ensure that information can  still flow effectively. That may be through physical or virtual networking, or (with software) through well-defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a></li><br>
  <li><strong>One source, many instances</strong> - standardise the way you work and then deploy that multiple times. If you're talking software, then have a single codebase to maintain, that is used by all your customers.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Rapid iteration</strong> - Standardisation can cause stagnation, but your customers' needs are changing all the time. Build in processes which allow you to make changes quickly to the customer experience.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Strong foundations</strong> - The underlying processes and systems that allow your organisation to work, once they're in place, will be very hard to change (eg. finance systems, server architectures, software language). That change becomes harder the more people that use them. When you're building, make sure your foundations are strong enough, not just for the first floor, but also to add an extension... Otherwise, as you grow, you will end up spending a lot money just to maintain the foundation elements.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Of course, there are compromises. Small organisations can't afford enterprise systems. At least that's the accepted wisdom. But much of the approach to scale is less about buying the big systems, it's about a mentality that is always thinking: "How will this work when we grow"?<br>
<br>
Here are some things even the smallest organisation can do, often for very little outlay:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Have a single phone number for customer enquiries. There are many companies offering virtual phone numbers that then allow you to redirect as required. Look for those that then allow you to add "extensions" easily.</li><br>
  <li>Avoid using spreadsheets to maintain any sorts of records about your customers. Find a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a> system that you can grow into.</li><br>
  <li>Keep modularity and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_customization">mass customisation</a> in mind whenever you are thinking about new products or services.</li><br>
  <li>Build sharing and communication in at the heart of what you do. Small organisations are best focussing on their external communications, using established consumer tools. As you grow, you may want to keep some communications in-house, but with the culture there, it's much easier to change or add-in a new tool.</li><br>
  <li>Make "Re-use" your mantra - whether you're talking about content, products, services, or waste. And avoid the sort of reuse where each customer gets a slightly different service that you then have to maintain separately. One product/service that can be used in multiple ways is the ideal.</li><br>
  <li>Keep talking to your customers about what they need, and regularly review what you're doing. Stopping should always be an option on the table.</li><br>
  <li>Build your organisation on systems and processes that have been proven in larger-scale situations, or make sure you can change horses easily when you need to.</li><br>

Through the generousity of many people working together towards a shared vision some great achievements have been made. Just look at projects such as Moodle, Wordpress, and most of the software that underpins the internet.<br>
<br>
When starting <a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/">Wyver Solutions</a>, my aim was to build it as much as possible on open-source principles - using open-source software, and being generous in our own approach to content and ideas. As well as keeping costs down, it also fits in with <a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/about/our-values/">our values</a>.<br>
<br>
But, at the same time, you have to be pragmatic. If using open-source software means that you will need to spend too much time learning new ways of working, or it means that you can't communicate with the rest of the world easily, then it's time to change. I made that decision years ago when I chose to go down the Mac OS route for operating systems, and now I'm having to make that decision for office software.<br>
<br>
Every organisation needs to have a suite of business communication software (ie. word processor, presentations and spreadsheets). Up to now, I've been working happily in <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>. That's fine if you are the only person involved, and the output is going to be a PDF.<br>
<br>
But as soon as you need to start sharing documents and presentations, with complex formatting, with other people who use other software (ie. MS Office), then it becomes time to fall into line and adopt what has become (through weight of numbers rather than any collective decision) the de facto standard.<br>
<br>
It came to a head when I spent hours on an OpenOffice Writer document that just wouldn't display correctly when converted to the Word .doc format. It would have been fine if I'd just been publishing a PDF, or working with someone who used a application that had adopted the OASIS <a href="http://opendocumentformat.org/">Open Document Format</a> (a worldwide standard). But, in most of the organisations I'm working with, MS Office (and the Microsoft interpretation of ODF) has become the standard way of working.<br>
<br>
So, it's time to get out the cash. Not because the software does anything better, but because, if I want to work with other people I need to fall into line.</div><h1>Tips for working in multiple time zones</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 September 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Going from a job where everything is UK-centric to one where I'm now working with people from across the US, Australia and Europe, I've had to get to grips with time zones pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
There have been a couple of embarrassing moments when I miscalculated, and ended up joining online meetings an hour late!<br>
<br>
Half the problem comes because most people tend to use their local time-zone abbreviation. That's fine if you're all in the same country, and know what those abbreviations mean. But when you're working globally it's a recipe for confusion.<br>
<br>
For example, how is someone to know whether Eastern Standard Time (EST) refers to EST in Australia or EST in North America? Does CST refer to China Standard Time, Central Standard Time (Australia), Central Standard Time (Central and North America), or Cuba Standard Time?<br>
<br>
It gets even more confusing when some countries (like the UK) change their clocks in the summer (for some strange, historical reason that seems to be to do with farmers in Scotland...).<br>
<br>
So to work out when a meeting should take place, I need to check with my colleagues which timezone they're in (checking the country to make sure) then work out the time difference between them and me. And everyone else in the meeting will need to do the same.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be much easier if there was a common reference point, so all we had to do was a quick calculation without all the complex looking up of individual time zone differences?<br>
<br>
Well, it exists. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)</a>. Every time zone is then defined as being UTC ± an integer number of hours.<br>
<br>
So, currently, I'm at UTC +1 (although that changes in October when the UK goes back to UTC Zero time)<br>
<br>
Boulder, Colorado, USA, (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/na/mdt.html">Mountain Daylight Time</a>) is at UTC - 6<br>
<br>
L'viv, Ukraine (Eastern European Summer Time) is at UTC + 3<br>
<br>
So, <strong>the only information anyone needs to provide, to arrange a meeting, is their UTC time zone offset</strong>, ie. UTC+1, UTC-6 and UTC+3<br>
<br>
There's no need for anyone to go looking for a <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">time-zone convertor</a><br>
<br>
Let's say the meeting is at 08:00 UTC-6<br>
<br>
For me, in the UK, the difference between -6 and +1 = +7, so I know that the meeting is at 3pm my time.<br>
<br>
For colleagues in L'viv, the meeting is at 08:00 + (difference between -6 and +3) = 08:00 + 9 = 5pm their time.<br>
<br>
Simples!<br>

Here's my current set (based on what I'm using at the moment):<br>
<br>
<ol><br>
  <li><a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> - one of the best mobile apps I've seen for consuming and filtering content.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html">Jing</a> - a free tool, from the makers of Camtasia, for creating quick annotated images or 5 minute screen capture movies</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - I'm starting to use this as my sole note-taking and thinking tool. The way it synchronizes across all my devices is almost magical!</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> - I haven't found a browser yet that matches it for simplicity and speed - essential for a knowledge worker</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a> - one of the most powerful multi-user, multi-blog platforms out there. I don't use even 50% of that power, but it's been the basis of my blog for many years. Its spam control measures are great.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> - the website/blogging platform of choice for new projects. It's just so simple to use and to tweak. Spam control is a bit rubbish though!</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> - after considerable research, this is still the best corporate social platform available. Great multi-platform capabilities, and they really understand what drives conversation.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> - even though the interface has now lost quite a bit of "social' functionality, it's still the place where I maintain the list of RSS feeds from people and organisations that keep me up-to-date. It's where I go for deep-thinking. The link with Flipboard is excellent.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> - Perfect for quick breaks to have a conversation with people who are around at the same time. Anything more extended than a couple of lines doesn't work on Twitter (IMO), but nice to feel you're part of a wider community. The link with Flipboard brings Twitter posts to life.</li><br>
  <li><a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">Yed Graph Editor</a> - I'm still playing with this, but it's becoming an extremely useful tool to me; for organising thoughts and ideas.</li><br>

So much so, that they have become my "goto" places when I need to explain why I do things the way I do:</p><br>
<p><a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/13">Some principles of effective e-learning</a>&nbsp;- Stephen Downes</p><br>
<p>Interaction, Usability and Relevance. That's all you need to know. Stephen goes on to provide examples from the real world (outside e-learning) where these principles have born fruit.</p><br>

<p><a href="http://doc.utwente.nl/36146/">Scaffolding by design: a model for WWW-based learner support</a>&nbsp;- J.C. Winnips</p><br>
<p>The concept of "Scaffolding", along with Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, whereby teachers provide just enough support to help learners move on to the next stage, has been key to my thinking around learning design. This is a meaty PhD thesis, but it's worth reading - even just section 2, where he sets out the model.</p><br>
<p><a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/wideopen">Wide Open</a>&nbsp;- Demos</p><br>
<p>Reading this paper, from the thinktank Demos, was the first time I'd come across the concept of "open source" being recognised in a wider context than software development. Concepts that are now widely promoted - such as the Open Knowledge Initiative and many other projects, both grassroots and institutional.</p><br>
<p><a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/newlearning.pdf">New Learning Environments for the 21st Century</a>&nbsp;- John Seely Brown</p><br>

<p>Yes, there are holes in this paper if you're looking at it from a serious academic perspective, but as a way of describing what is happening with society, technology and learning, connectivism is very hard to argue with.

Reposted with some slight changes.<br>
<br>
<p>It seems that, for years, people have been writing obituaries for the corporate Learning Management System (LMS). Just do a quick search for “LMS is dead” and you’ll find many blog posts, articles, webinars and conference presentations discussing its demise. Some people, <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/15/the-lms-must-die">myself included</a>, have even been actively working towards this end trying to hasten its death through carefully worded argument and debate.</p><br>
<p>The trouble is that many organisations have invested heavily in their LMS. Somehow that investment needs to be recouped.</p><br>
<p>Rather than throw the whole thing out, its role needs to be adjusted so the LMS becomes a better fit for what is needed now.</p><br>
<br>
<p>Let's look at some of the typical problems encountered with most modern-day LMS implementations:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li><b>They lock content away inside monolithic SCORM packages</b>, often making little use of metadata, and no use of deep textual searching, to help people find content.</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>They are separate from work.</b> The model is like that of a separate training room and trainer, rather than a coach who works with you when you need it. Which do you think is the most effective?</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>They are difficult to use.</b> I have worked with an LMS bundled by a major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning">ERP</a> system provider which had, by far, the most unintuitive interface and user workflows I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. This is not atypical. If we have to train end-users (NB. not administrators...) to use our systems, then we've done something seriously wrong!</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>They have little to do with informal learning.</b> The title says it all: Learning <em>Management</em> System. The LMS is about supporting formal training, and helping organisations work out which people should undertake which training. As most of us realise, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the real learning that is taking place inside organisations. It's important, but the mismatch of investment between formal and informal learning often seems unjustifiable.</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>They record data that has little meaning.</b> Don't get me started... So many managers seem to think that if you record the fact that someone has viewed every page or can answer 10 questions straight after reading the content, that equates to them having learned something. (Perhaps, if we point them towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</a>, we might help them to change their minds.) We need to learn how to make the important measurable, rather than the measurable important. All we are doing currently is measuring inputs, but treating that as evidence. That can't be right, can it?</li><br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
But what are LMS's good at:<br>
<br>
<ul><br>
<br>
<li><b>Administering and recording training activity.</b> For organisations that manage their face-to-face training on spreadsheets, often with large teams just moving bits of paper around, the LMS (or a better description: Training Administration System) brings massive benefits in efficiency, in reporting, and, often, in accuracy. Let's be clear. If you have a definite need to run formal training (whether online or face-to-face) an LMS is a useful tool for administering that training (although not necessarily for delivering it).</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>Delivering computer-marked assessments.</b> I don't mean the assessments that come in SCORM packages - where the only output is a pass or fail. I mean industrial strength multiple choice exams, with randomisation from a pool of questions and deep analysis tools (including ones which help you assess the effectiveness of each question).</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>Joining up competencies and performance data with learning opportunities.</b> This is where some of the major LMS's are heading - towards talent management. It's an obvious use case. But it does depend on one key thing - the competency and performance data must be accurate, consistent and up-to-date for the system to work effectively. If you've got that, then great. If not, then your investment may be somewhat wasted.</li><br>
<br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<p>To meet these challenges, it's not really the LMS that is changing, but the role it plays in a wider learning and corporate ecosystem.</p><br>
<p>Alongside the formal learning opportunities provided and administered by the training department, we are now seeing systems put in place that, although not marketed as learning systems, are ideal for supporting informal learning:</p><br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Systems like social networking tools - which enable better communication across organisational silos.</li><br>
  <li>Systems that allow user-generated content, particularly video, to be shared.</li><br>
  <li>Systems (like Xyleme's <a href="http://www.xyleme.com/product/bravais">Bravais</a>) that enable content to be published to a repository <em>outside</em> of the LMS for use in a much larger, searchable, informal learning context.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
<p>The important thing to note is that, often, these systems are not bought in by the training or L&amp;D department, but by Operations. They're not bought as learning tools, but as a means of getting the job done.</p><br>
<br>
<p>So, we shouldn't write off the LMS just yet. But perhaps it's time for a rethink about where it fits best, and, maybe even stop trying to do <em>everything</em> with it?</p></div><h1>Midlands Learning Tweetup</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 5 November 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>If you're around in the Derby area during the evening of Monday 12th November, come and join us at The Brunswick Inn, Railway Terrace, Derby, DE1 2RU<br>

It’ll all be very informal!</div><h1>Characteristics of good elearning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 13 November 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>You may as well ask "What makes a good book?" when thinking about the characteristics of good elearning. It depends on what it's trying to achieve, who it's aimed at, and the context in which it will be used. Are we talking about a novel, a textbook, a reference, a coffee table book, a children's picture book, etc?<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I'm going to try...<br>
<br>
This thought process started during the recent <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/11/05/midlands-learning-tweetup">Midlands Learning Tweetup</a>. During the course of the evening, many topics were covered, but one stuck in my mind... We were trying to come up with examples of good elearning. It's not easy! Especially when "good" means "effective" - ie. they actually help people to learn, to make a lasting change. (See the <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning">Elearning Network's Campaign for Effective Elearning</a>)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, on reflection, I've come up with three characteristics that might help us to identify effective elearning. (But use them alongside Stephen Downes excellent article on <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/13">Principles of Effective Elearning</a>)<br>
<br>
<h2>Desirable</h2><br>
<br>
For any learning experience to be truly effective, people must be motivated to go through that experience. With elearning, when there's often little input from other people to cajole or encourage, that motivation needs be engendered by the materials themselves.<br>
<br>
Ideally, the materials would be published in a place and at a time when there's already a desire for them (just like the way a book publisher would market a celebrity chef cookbook at the same time as their TV programme is airing). For example, it'd be great to publish a compliance course on information security just when there's been a major security breach with public consequences!<br>
<br>
When that can't happen, it's the designer's job to do everything they can to grab attention as early as possible. Again, just like a book in a bookstore, you need to think about factors like:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>Initial reactions to things like the title and the blurb/description - what will make your target user want to click on the link to open the elearning? Using the "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don't make me think</a>" principles (and remembering that people very rarely read what they see on a web page), make sure you use words that will be meaningful to the users.</li><br>
  <li>Do you need to make it <em>look</em> attractive? How much do you need to work on things like art direction - where you create a coherent look and feel? Or is the content in itself going to be enough to attract people?</li><br>
  <li>What is going to keep people with you as they use the materials? What's going to make them want to "click next"? How will you draw them into the story? What will make them stick with it until the end? Is there something to achieve? Something that they can only find out when they get to the end? If you're creating a linear elearning package, then you must think like a screen-writer or an author. Keep giving users something, but keep them wanting more. If you're creating a non-linear package, then think like a game writer. What will be the routes that people will take? What short cuts do you need to put in? What help will they need along the way?</li><br>
<li>What will make people want to tell their friends/colleagues about the elearning? Think about what people share on the internet... it's usually stuff this is funny, controversial or useful. Which of these categories are you going to work with?</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
Of course, if your learners already want to learn all you need to do is provide them with instruction and information. But don't necessarily assume that they all have that required level of motivation. Just because <em>you</em> think something is important doesn't mean everyone does! <br>
<br>
<h2>Thought-provoking</h2><br>
<br>
It's all very well having fun while using elearning materials. But what you're trying to do is get people to change the way they behave or think. For that to occur, good elearning will cause people to reflect on what they currently do/think and start working the way the elearning is suggesting. You actually want to bring in some element of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>" - putting people in a state where they may end up trying to hold two conflicting ideas.<br>
<br>
Often, this brings out some emotion. But, even if people disagree with what the content is saying, at least you've stimulated a reaction. That's better than no reaction at all.<br>
<br>
You're wanting people to question what is happening, then to question their own behaviours and thinking, and then to change. In marketing terms, it's the point of "conversion" - The point at which a recipient of a marketing message performs a desired action (<a href="http://sherpablog.marketingsherpa.com/marketing/conversion-defined/">MarketingSherpa blog: Conversion defined</a>).<br>
<br>
<h2>Sticky</h2><br>
<br>
<blockquote>"All sorts of ideas, if left to themselves, are gradually forgotten."<br>
<br>
<a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/memory7.htm">Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology, Chapter VII</a>, Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885)<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
If you need to be convinced of that, read up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</a>, which shows "that humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material."<br>
<br>
Ebbinghaus's theory, which seems to fit practice very well, is that the speed of forgetting depends on two main factors:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li>how the memory is represented in the brain</li><br>
  <li>repetition</li><br>
</ol><br>
<br>
If the idea is easy to remember - ie. it can be represented through a number of senses (an image, a smell, a sound) and connects into existing memories then repetition is less important.<br>
<br>
If the idea is more abstract and less connected to other memories (eg. a phone number) then repetition is essential. "The capacity of memory is initially less than 30 seconds. If we don't repeat the information it disappears." <a href="http://www.brainrules.net/short-term-memory">John Medina - Brain Rules: Short Term memory</a><br>
<br>
Just because someone can answer a quiz at the end of your elearning package doesn't mean that they will remember it tomorrow, or even in an hour's time.<br>
<br>
Good elearning design incorporates elements that will help users to remember what they're learning, like repetition, connections to previous ideas, and connections to other senses.<br>
<br>
But good learning <em>solution</em> design makes sure that repetition is built in across the whole solution, not just a package that may be used for 20 minutes, but also in the pre and post communications, and in any face-to-face or virtual events.</div><h1>Christmas Linebacker</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 7 December 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>In our house we're starting to gear up for Christmas big style... presents, decorations, food, wine, <a href="http://www.churchinthepeak.org.uk/">carol service preparation</a> ....

[youtube]lnOsoSQHNIM[/youtube]</div><h1>When only face to face will do</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 12 December 2012</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Last Saturday, I spent the morning working with a group from <a href="http://www.churchinthepeak.org.uk/">Church in the Peak</a> who wanted to learn how to setup and run our PA system.<br>
<br>
We started by unpacking all the component parts: the mixing desk, cables, multicore, microphones, mic stands, DI boxes, amplifier and speakers.<br>
<br>
Then, using a series of slides containing images of the components and their connections as a guide, we began to connect things together. First off, the keyboard to the mixing desk and a monitor amp, via a DI box.Then onto the mics, making sure we keep things simple by maintaining strict control of which mic goes in which channel.<br>
<br>
And then we moved onto the mixing desk. As we worked our way down the channel strip we did a bit of theory (loudspeaker dispersion patterns, impedance, clipping, frequency bands, cardioid pickup patterns etc), every time followed by hands-on tweaking to see what each bit did. As we "played" this led to further learning opportunities. For example, when pushing up the mid-range EQ control, we got feedback, so we then looked at how feedback could be kept under control.<br>
<br>
All the time we brought it back to our own particular context; considering the room we meet in, where the speakers and mixing desk are located, and how to make it work best for the musicians, speakers, contributors and congregation.<br>
<br>
At the end, there was another practical exercise - putting it all away tidily. With a particular focus on how to roll up cables so they don't kink!<br>
<br>
Now, given my background and profession, you might expect me to argue that part of this could have been done online. Well, yes, probably a lot of the theory, and maybe some assessment could have been done away from the training session. And I will be putting some follow-up resources online for people to look at. But, really, in this case there was no substitute for real, hands-on practice.<br>
<br>
To achieve the same results with a totally online experience would require a somewhat expensive simulation. A bit of a waste when there are only ten people to be trained.<br>
<br>
But what if I was working with, say, 20 churches. Would that change the balance?<br>
<br>
Quite probably. In that case, I would put a lot more effort into creating some generic resources that could be applied in multiple contexts. Ideally these would be put into practice in safe environments supported by coaches. But most churches don't have that luxury. Often the only time the PA comes out is on a Sunday when it has to work, and it has to work without mishap. Although the church is a very forgiving environment (well, it should be... given what we're about!) there's a limit to what people will put up with in terms of squeaks, crackles and dead microphones.<br>
<br>
So, you have to give people time to play, and that's where the face-to-face workshop comes in. If it was only used for getting across the theory and answering questions, then face to face is unnecessary, but as a place to try out new ideas and to practice with immediate "feedback", it is unrivalled.<br>
<br>
What about you? Are there cases in your workplaces where only face to face will work? How do you analyse and justify your choice of learning environment? How do you design learning opportunities so that the face-time supports and enhances the online time, and vice versa?</div><h1>The right conditions for learning</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 16 January 2013</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p>Jay Cross, many moons ago, likened the job of a learning designer to that of a gardener. Yet too often, we treat learning as if it was a part in a machine.<br>
<br>
Just like plants, people are complicated. Each individual needs just the right combination of external conditions,  previous history, genetics and nutrients in order to flourish. The gardener's role is to help get the right plant in the right place and provide the necessary environment for growth.<br>
<br>
(At that point the analogy can fall down - especially when you get into pruning!)<br>
<br>
We have an endemic problem in our society - in that a love of learning for its own sake, and the self-motivation needed for effective learning are educated out of us at school. If you don't believe that, then watch Sir Ken Robinson's talk below.<br>
<br>
Yet all of us are natural learners. From birth, we've been absorbing as much as we can take. Given the right conditions - of encouragement, challenge, modelling behaviour and access to expertise - we develop and grow intellectually, emotionally and physically.<br>
<br>
Then "society" determines that there are certain things that need to take priority over others, and we go to school to be taught by the experts, and tested to make sure the experts are doing their jobs right. However much those experts want to develop and nurture the children in their care, they are constrained by society at large.<br>
<br>
The huge majority of people are highly able language learners. We've done it once and can communicate effectively in one language. At school, in general in the UK, we fail dismally at language learning (going by the lack of ability most people have in a second language when they leave school). But all it takes is the right environment and a bit of external motivation (eg. I must communicate if I want food!) In other countries, where the motivation is higher and the environment more conducive, learning a second, third or even fourth language is the norm. It's actually very little to do with the teaching techniques - it's much more about the conditions.<br>
<br>
There's probably little we can do to change schools and education - given the weight of public opinion that is stuck with Victorian ideas about learning. But let's not accept those ideas in the workplace.<br>
<br>
In workplace learning, we tend to focus a lot on the learning intervention itself (whether it's a workshop, an elearning package, a mobile app etc), but spend very little time on fostering the conditions that will encourage learning &amp; development. Our interventions would be so much more effective if they took place in the right conditions. Currently, it's like a gardener applying Miracle Gro, but to plants that are kept in the dark, with no water!<br>
<br>
Just like a plant need light, wamth and water. What conditions are best for effective learning &amp; development?<br>
<br>
I would argue that the following are essential:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>a culture where a mistake is treated as a learning point not a failure</li><br>
  <li>a management culture built on coaching and challenging to improve</li><br>
  <li>access to expertise that people can understand when they need it</li><br>
  <li>immersion in the practices, behaviours or knowledge that we are trying to teach</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
There will be times when the conditions are not quite right, just like a gardener starting out with an uncultivated patch of land. There's no point just adding the Miracle Gro intervention and expecting it to work. A lot of effort will be need to get the other conditions right first.<br>

I was prompted to write this one, though, when the guys from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> asked if I would review their latest book on Yammer.<br>
<br>
Packt Publishing have achieved a great reputation for putting out books just at the point when they are going to be needed by more than just the early adopters of a particular technology.<br>
<br>
That is true of this book, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/yammer-starter/book">Yammer Starter</a>. <a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>, the enterprise social network tool now owned by Microsoft is starting to go mainstream, alongside its competitors like <a href="http://socialcast.com/">Socialcast</a> and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/overview/">Salesforce Chatter</a>. As well as the bottom-up, slightly subversive, activities which have driven their adoption to date, we are now seeing senior managers, even at Board level, pushing for their use.<br>
<br>
Partly this is a matter of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses">keeping up with the Joneses</a>", but there are real business benefits to be had from social networking tools like these. Primarily, they are fantastic at breaking down internal, organisational silos, and allowing information to flow between them. I've, personally, seen this happen in a sales context with questions and answers about products and clients moving between sales teams that wouldn't have taken place in any other way.<br>
<br>
But, to the book...<br>
<br>
Before reading it, I had certain expectations about what would be included in a book like this. Back in 2010, I wrote my own <a href="http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/04/29/yammer-best-practice-guide-yam?blog=5">Yammer Best Practice Guide</a>, and Yammer have also created an array of support materials in their <a href="http://success.yammer.com/">Yammer Success Center</a>.<br>
<br>
I was looking for things like:<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>What Yammer can bring to an organisation</li><br>
  <li>Ideas on how to roll out Yammer organisation-wide</li><br>
  <li>A explanation of what Yammer can bring to an individual (the "what's in it for me" question)</li><br>
  <li>Guidelines on "best practice" in using the system</li><br>
  <li>How to pre-empt, and subsequently deal with, the occasional lapses in <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html">netiquette</a> that will occur</li><br>
  <li>The role of the community facilitator</li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>
Given the rapid rate of change of any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> tool like Yammer, I would not expect detail descriptions of functionality or step-by-step instructions. These would only be current and accurate for a very short time, and therefore not appropriate to put into a book format.<br>
<br>
The book itself is very short, and only available in eBook format (PDF, PacktLib, ePub and Mobi). At £3.39 or thereabouts, it's not going to break the bank, but then it's also not going to have much detail.<br>
<br>
It has all the basic functionality you'd expect from an eBook; table of contents etc. So, no problems there.<br>
<br>
Things do go a bit awry on the first page though...<br>
<br>
Remember that Yammer is a web-based system. You get to it using your browser. There's nothing to install or download (unless you use the mobile/desktop apps - which are just useful extras, not essential). So I really don't understand why the author starts the book with a section on how to download and install Yammer? I may just be being picky, but using language like this right at the start doesn't bode well for the rest of the book. I would have much preferred this section be called "Setting up" rather than "Installation"...<br>
<br>
Apart from that, the rest of the book contains a lot of information, useful to someone who is entirely new to Yammer (although it would help to have a little bit of a background in Facebook, Google+ or Twitter to understand some of the references).<br>
<br>
There are a few too many screenshots and lists of instructions for me to be comfortable with the longevity of the book. It will need updating the next time Yammer makes a change to their interface. But, I suppose that's just part of the business model for this sort of publication.<br>
<br>
The author does use a lot of examples to give context to the generic practice he's discussing. This is useful, as without such illustrations it can be hard to visualise what a tool like Yammer can offer.<br>
<br>
He has organised the book around Yammer's functions, which is a common practice in such publications. It would have been nice to see it organised around business problems, such as "How can we organise information in Yammer?" or "How do I find out who X works for?" which then lead onto discussions of functionality.<br>
<br>
The reasons for using each piece of functionality are mentioned briefly, but I don't feel there's enough in the book that addresses the "What's in it for me?" question, nor is there any consideration of Best Practices. The author is majoring on what <strong>can</strong> be done with the tool, rather than why it should be done or whether it should be done at all...<br>
<br>
There is also no discussion of how to roll out Yammer into an organisation, and how to move from a bottom-up Yammer implementation (where a bunch of enthusiasts start using it for free) to an officially-sanctioned part of the organisation's communication toolkit.<br>
<br>
To be honest, there's not much in this book that you cannot get from either Yammer's comprehensive <a href="https://help.yammer.com/">Help Center</a> or from their <a href="http://success.yammer.com/">Success Center</a> (which is full of ideas and materials to get your Yammer network off to a flying start).<br>
<br>
However, if you want something that you can read offline, perhaps whilst travelling, then (apart from the installation issue mentioned earlier) this eBook would be an ideal starter guide. Use it as an overview of what's possible and then go back to your network to try it out.<br>
<br>
Just remember that Yammer, like all social networks, cannot be controlled. People need to be persuaded and excited rather than instructed. As soon as you try to lock it down, or dictate how it should be used, your people will either choose not to use it, or simply bypass your rules. None of this is mentioned in the book, so you will need to read it in conjunction with Yammer's "<a href="http://success.yammer.com/essentials-for-success/">Essentials for Success</a>" too.<br>

<br>
Over the years, I've come across a few people that I know write useful, balanced and objective white-papers and articles. I've learnt who to trust, and who to just ignore - not because of the individuals concerned, but because of the motives of their employers.<br>

<p>There’s a lot of debate around at the moment about MOOC’s (Massive Online Open Courses) in all their variants. In particular, there’s the question about how they can continue with no obvious business model?</p><br>
<p>It’s the same for any “open” project, whether it’s open source software or open courses. The project must have a business model that ensures its long-term viability for people to trust that it’s worth investing time and effort into.</p><br>
<p>There are as many business models as there are open projects. What’s key is that the people developing the project are able to treat it as their “work” and not just “hobby”. This means that need to be paid for the time they invest in the project – whether that’s immediately, or at some point in the future.</p><br>
<p>One particular favourite of mine comes from a Management Consultancy in the US:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/" target="_blank">Manager Tools</a>.</p><br>
<p>Go to their website and you will find one of the best management development resources available in the English-speaking world (my opinion). Most of that is given for free, without even requiring any sort of registration. With about&nbsp;85,000 downloads per week, you get an indication of how useful their materials are.</p><br>
<p>This has been going on for many years, and the resource is continually added to. It’s good stuff. High-quality. And immediately useful. They’ve invested considerable time and money into making it.</p><br>
<p>What the Manager Tools team have done is realise that generic content needs to be free. That’s just how the internet works.</p><br>
<p>But people are prepared to pay for the stuff that is bespoke to them. And, if they know it’s going to be high-quality, they’ll pay a lot of money.</p><br>
<p>By giving away their content, Manager Tools have demonstrated their capability. You know what you’re going to get from them.</p><br>
<p>More than that, the team have built up a community of over 37,000 people who have&nbsp;<strong>chosen</strong>&nbsp;to register and take part in their open forums.</p><br>
<p>Having built up a reputation for good, useful advice, the Manager Tools team have been able to realise its value in three ways:</p><br>
<ol><br>
<li>By hosting expensive, high quality, medium-scale, conferences where participants are able to put into practice the guidance in the materials whilst being observed by experienced coaches.</li><br>
<li>By providing bespoke consultancy services for organisations wishing to improve their management practices.</li><br>
<li>By creating bundles of materials that can be purchased to support the free materials.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<p>So, what’s the challenge for our education &amp; training organisations today (whether F/HE or workplace)?</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>What are we doing to prove our capability with our target market? There’s no point just telling them what we can do, we need to demonstrate it – in the open, for free.</li><br>
<li>What are people prepared to pay for? In education &amp; training, I would argue that this probably consists of qualifications with a good reputation and materials &amp; advice that are bespoke to the individual or their team. The days of costly, generic, mass-market education and training are numbered. Instead, we should perhaps be thinking about providing no-cost education &amp; training to the mass market, and focus on selling to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" target="_blank">long tail</a>.</li><br>
</ul></div><h1>How to open a bottle of wine</h1><div class="post"><p class="date"><em>Date posted: 9 July 2014</em></p><p class="url"><a href=""></a></p><p>I was in a meeting today where it was suggested that purchasing organisations could differentiate between potential elearning suppliers by using a standard "problem" as a challenge. A problem like "Create some elearning about how to open a bottle of wine".</p><br>
<p>There would be no opportunity to ask any questions. In fact, it was even suggested that these elearning materials could be used as demonstration packages for multiple potential buyers.</p><br>
<p>I'm sorry, but I just don't buy that...</p><br>
<p>I have any number of tools &amp; techniques at my disposal to create elearning materials about how to open a bottle of wine.</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Using InDesign, I might create a glossy interactive PDF with a nice, graphically-rich, description of the various steps involved</li><br>
<li>Using Word, I might create a simple step-by-step process, with a few images to support the text</li><br>
<li>Using Xerte, I might create a small HTML5 package which can be tracked in a learning management system</li><br>
<li>Using iMovie and my phone, I might create a 1 minute video with voice-over and put it on Youtube</li><br>
<li>Using Wordpress, I might create a whole website about the history of wine, the role of the sommelier, and why opening it in a particular way is vitally important</li><br>
</ul><br>
<p>As a buyer, how would you decide which is best?</p><br>
<p>Without the dialogue in advance of building the materials, it's impossible to know which is the right one.</p><br>
<p>Questions you might want to ask are:</p><br>
<ul><br>
<li>Do your learners like wine?</li><br>
<li>Have they come across wine before?</li><br>
<li>What about the people that prefer beer, and don't want to change?</li><br>
<li>Do you need to track usage?</li><br>
<li>Do you have a Learning Management System?</li><br>
<li>Do your learners need performance support or do they need to have their thinking about wine changed?</li><br>
<li>Where will the learners need to get to the materials? Will they be at their desks? Or out and about?</li><br>
<li>How soon do you need it?</li><br>
<li>Do you have a budget for good-looking graphical design?</li><br>
<li>Do you have a learning management system? Do you need to track learner activity?</li><br>
