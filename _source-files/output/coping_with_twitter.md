# Coping with Twitter {#coping-with-twitter}

_Date posted: 26 February 2010_

#yam Twitter is a great tool for spreading messages and ideas through your network. It also devours time. Not every Twitter message posted by the people you follow will be relevant to you. It's a bit like being in a big hall with a large group of people shouting at you, and then you shouting out anything that comes into your head. Not really a good environment for a conversation. I've decided that I just don't have enough spare time to listen in to all the people I follow. Instead I'm going to use Twitter more strategically.

### Time-limited sessions {#time-limited-sessions}

As a means of collecting together ideas around an event, Twitter is hard to beat. Simply attach an event-specific tag (like #LT10uk) to your post and it can then become part of a list of tweets filtered on that tag. Again, not so good for conversation, but ideal to pick up what's grabbing people's attention.

### Use RSS to pick up your Twitter feed {#use-rss-to-pick-up-your-twitter-feed}

I have an RSS set up for any Tweet containing @berthelemy. This comes into Google Reader. It means I don't miss messages directed to me, but also means they come to me, rather than me having to go to a Twitter client, with the potential for time-wasting that will involve. I can do a similar thing for any other saved search.

### Post via RSS to Twitter {#post-via-rss-to-twitter}

With [Twitterfeed](http://twitterfeed.com/), any new post or comment on my blog automatically gets posted to my Twitter network. Again, it means I avoid using a Twitter client.

### Use a Twitter client sparingly {#use-a-twitter-client-sparingly}

As you can see I will rarely use a Twitter client (like Twitterfall). What this means is that I will then make a deliberate decision to spend time with the people I follow. How do you make sure Twitter doesn't devour your time?
