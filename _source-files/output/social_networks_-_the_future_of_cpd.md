# Social Networks - the future of CPD {#social-networks-the-future-of-cpd}

_Date posted: 29 October 2007_

I'm leading one of the sessions at tomorrow's elearning & esafety conference for Norfolk headteachers. It's entitled "Social Networks - the future of CPD". Although rather than focus of social networks per se, I'm looking wider... at informal learning, at communities of practice, at using technology to help widen the CoPs, and at the skills required from teachers in order to effectively engage with their own CPD. I've prepared a [draft version of the presentation](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/presentations/Social_Networks_-_the_future_of_CPD/launcher.html), with a quick narration to go with it. You'll need speakers or headphones to hear the narration.
