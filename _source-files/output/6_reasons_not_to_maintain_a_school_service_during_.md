# 6 reasons not to maintain a school service during closure days {#6-reasons-not-to-maintain-a-school-service-during-closure-days}

_Date posted: 7 January 2011_

Both my children's schools were closed for over three days last week due to snow. It was definitely right to close the buildings, but no explanation came from the schools as to why all teaching and learning activity also had to stop. Both schools have [learning platforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_platform) (or [VLEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment)). In my view, a school that has embedded usage of these tools in their day to day activity should not need to stop work when the buildings are closed. But here are 6 reasons for schools who don't want to use technology to maintain a service during closure days:

1.  It's too different to how we normally operate, so the students won't be able to handle it.[My response: Why aren't you using these tools to support your normal work?]
2.  Our teachers are not confident in the use of these tools.[My response: Why not?]
3.  Some of the students do not have internet access.[My response: OK. So how are you going to plan ahead so that these students can have access - whether at friends or elsewhere?]
4.  Some of the teachers do not have internet access.[My response: How can a teacher be effective these days without it? How are you going to plan ahead so they can get access when it's needed?]
5.  We don't have a Learning Platform.[My response: You don't need one. Just start by using the masses of free tools listed on [Jane Hart's C4LPT website](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html). Or sign-up for [Google Apps for Educators](http://www.google.com/educators/p_apps.html) (also free). When you have worked out what you really need a Learning Platform to do, then you can start to think about buying one to meet your specific needs.]
6.  The students wouldn't do the work anyway.[My response: What are your expectations of the students? What incentives do you already use as part of classroom management? What support do teachers get from Senior Management in handling unwilling learners? Why can't you extend those strategies to online work as well?]
7.  It's extra work for the teachers to produce all the resources required.[My response: Yes, maybe. But there are real, practical benefits to teaching and learning online that will balance it out, such as: automated marking, deeper and broader learning, opportunity for less confident learners to contribute etc (See the [European Education Partnership for more](http://www.eep-edu.org/InnService/Start/what_addval_start.htm))]

What reasons did your school give for not maintaining a service last week? What are their strategies in the case of a long term closure (such as with a flu epidemic)? Are these really practical if they're not already putting those strategies in practice on a day-to-day basis? For more, see the Naace press release on "[Two kinds of school](http://www.naace.co.uk/twokindsofschool)" [Update] Northern Echo news report: [Stranded students log on from home](http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8721526.Stranded_students_log_on_from_home_via_web/). What a shame this is still newsworthy! [Update 2] As you will notice - I can't count!
