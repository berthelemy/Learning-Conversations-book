Just in case I haven't mentioned this before. This is one of Stephen Downes' talks that you shouldn't miss. I listened to it in the car on CD, so difficult to take notes. Perhaps I'll get an ipod or similar sometime...

> The MP3 of my online talk, Living in a Distributed World is now available. In this talk I contrast centralized and distributed approaches to learning technology and outline the distributed approach. The [PowerPoint slides](http://www.downes.ca/files/DistributedWorld.ppt) are also available, or if you wish, you can view the session [directly on Elluminate](http://www.odysseylearn.com/elive/StephenDownes.jnlp).
