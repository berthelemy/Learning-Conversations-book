Great video from [Nigel Paine](http://www.nigelpaine.com/), produced by [GoodPractice](http://goodpractice.com/blog/the-learning-explosion-nigel-paine/), focussing on how learning will become central to organisational effectiveness. But, for that to happen, our whole thinking about the "learning" function needs to change. It's not about knowledge, or even competencies. It's about how people really behave.
