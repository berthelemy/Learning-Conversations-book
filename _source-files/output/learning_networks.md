Stephen Downes captures perfectly what it means to base our learning ecologies on networks. (Powerpoint slides + mp3 audio) Critical points for me:

> ... theories of online distance learning must:
> 
> *   capture the expression of self as a network of connections
> *   place this self at the centre of the learning experience

and, in comparing "traditional" with "networked" delivery models:

> **Traditional Online Learning** Institution Based:
> 
> *   Online courses, learning management system
> *   Content �federations� � closed network
> 
> Product Based:
> 
> *   Content packaging and CD-ROM delivery
> *   Digital rights and authentication
> 
> Content Based:
> 
> *   The idea of courseware, course packs
> *   Learning design and sequencing
> 
> **Learning Networks** Not Institution Based:
> 
> *   Resource based, learning integration
> *   Open access, content networks
> 
> Not Product Based:
> 
> *   Web based, content not packaged but agregated
> *   Identity used to enable access, not restrict it
> 
> Not Content Based:
> 
> *   E-learning as engagement, conversation
> *   Focus on services and interaction
