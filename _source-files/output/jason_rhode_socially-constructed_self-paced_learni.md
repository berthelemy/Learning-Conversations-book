# Jason Rhode: Socially-Constructed Self-Paced Learning: VoiceThread {#jason-rhode-socially-constructed-self-paced-learning-voicethread}

I've come across a few [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) based sites now that wouldn't allow comments without a login, but offered no means of registering for a password - very odd. Anyway, Jason used [VoiceThread](http://voicethread.com/) very effectively to provide commentary on his [model for socially-constructed self-paced learning](http://www.idolresources.com/?p=460). I tried to post this comment on his site, but got stopped by WordPress, so here goes... Fantastic use of the VoiceThread tool. However, until they get a viable business model, I wouldn't want to use it for resources that I want to hang around for a long time. Great for meeting the immediate needs of a particular learner group though. I think your model paints a very good picture of a "modern" learning institution. The bit I see missing is how the initial connection is made to other cohorts or individuals outside of your original cohort. Is that the role of a tutor? To make the introductions? Or do you see this happening serendipitously, as in [Elgg](http://elgg.org/)? From experience in doing an entirely online Masters, I know how hard it is to get people talking even within the cohort. Which is where [Gilly Salmon's model](http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml) comes in useful. However, that's for tutor/cohort driven courses - not self-paced.
