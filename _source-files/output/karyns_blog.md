I work with Karyn. Her blog postings about her learning journey are always inciteful and written with feeling. Her recent posting on [Formal & Informal learning](http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/2005/11/formal-or-informal.html) summarizes the dichotomy between them and raises some of the issues about how we measure informal learning.
