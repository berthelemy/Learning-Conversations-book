Forget the Halloween link - but instead read this insightful article by John Hagel (often to be found collaborating with John Seely-Brown). Apart from some key thoughts that break down some of business's sacred cows about the need for data prior to decision making, and about the need to focus on the core business, he also fixes his eye again on education:

> Education (and let's throw in training while we are at it) is bankrupt - we don't need to fix it; we need to start from scratch and re-think it, starting with the terminology. It represents a huge drain on resources at best and, at worst, takes bright and inquiring minds and slowly but inevitably extinguishes passion for learning... We need to learn ... to develop new institutional learning architectures recognizing that learning is a life-long requirement and that push approaches play an increasingly marginal role in successful learning.

I agree. Pull is very much about the individual taking responsibility for their own learning - which means the individual needs to know what they need to learn. That is a major change of attitude, culture and preconceptions. So, where do we start?
