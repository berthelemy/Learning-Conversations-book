Picked this up from [Will Richardson](http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2006/02/15#a4700). Good to see the work being done in Bolton is spreading around the world. Will writes: "Wikiville is the idea of John Bidder who wants to create a place where kids from around the world can come and add descriptions and narratives about the places they live." I'd love to see a similar thing for primary age children to post local history topics... Something to think about?
