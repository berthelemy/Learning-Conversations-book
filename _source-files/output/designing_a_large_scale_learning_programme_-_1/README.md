# Designing a large scale learning programme - 1 {#designing-a-large-scale-learning-programme-1}

When it comes to designing a large-scale learning programme, the processes you work through are probably not much different to building something just for your team. The difference is that you will need to be much more explicit in your thinking, rather than relying on gut instinct. When I start out with a new learning programme I try to split my work into three core areas:

*   Learning architecture
*   Technology infrastructure
*   People (probably the most important)

Getting the learning architecture is important, but, if you get the technology or the people aspects wrong then nothing's going to make the learning work! Much of the thinking is iterative; as soon as you get one thing sorted you need to go back and work out its impact on the rest of the design. Throughout the process, the role of the Solutions Architect is to balance the needs of the organisation and the needs of the learner with the resources available (eg. systems, budgets, people). Just like in a real-world building project, getting the architect in early is essential. On large-scale projects there's no point giving the builder their instructions on what to build, and then bringing in an architect to make sure they do it properly. The architect is the link between your organisation's real (rather than perceived) needs and the solution to those needs.
