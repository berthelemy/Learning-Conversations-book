# Highly cost effective video-based learning {#highly-cost-effective-video-based-learning}

You've identified a learning need. Let's say you need people to know the best way to use a particular piece of equipment. In this case, there is only one way to use it, and the aim is to save people time rather than get them to understand the disadvantages of using it wrongly. By far the best way to approach this learning problem is likely to be with live action video. There are four things to consider:

1.  How will you record the video?
2.  How will you edit the video?
3.  How will learners find the video?
4.  How will you measure the results?

### Recording {#recording}

The example below was recorded using a very low cost, handheld [Flip video camera](http://support.theflip.com/en-uk/home) - now, sadly, not in production, but there are many similar products, including the rather excellent [Kodak Zi-8](http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Zi8_Pocket_Video_Camera/productID.156585800). The commentary was recorded using my PC headset - again, nothing special. The key thing was the planning. I'd worked out the process that I needed to explain beforehand, and then ran through the process whilst recording in a series of shots. Total filming time: 15 minutes

### Editing {#editing}

The raw footage was pulled into iMovie (which comes free with any Mac). There are similar free tools available for Windows (eg. [Windows Movie Maker](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-movie-maker-get-started)). The editing process consisted simply of trimming the shots where necessary, joining them together with (subtle) transitions, recording the commentary (whilst still keeping the sounds recorded during the filming to provide an audio backdrop), and then adding the titles. Total editing time: 60 minutes - just because I was learning how to do it at the same time.

### Distribution {#distribution}

The film was recorded because I knew, from personal experience, that there was no help available for this particular task, and wanted to share what I had learnt. I wanted to make it as widely available as possible, as the potential audience was worldwide. If I'd wanted to limit the audience then it would have made distribution far, far harder! So I popped it on Youtube. There are two versions - with different levels of rendering quality. (Again, I was experimenting here). Total time for worldwide distribution: 15 minutes

### Results {#results}

After a year, between the two versions, the video has been viewed 25,000 times. To me that's phenomenal! After all, it's only about changing a car lightbulb! There have been 44 comments so far - mostly expressing how much time has been saved. I would expect (from my experience of social media) that these comments reflect a much greater number of people who didn't comment. Going on the [100:10:1](http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2008/05/another-application-for-100101-rule.html) ratio normally quoted, I would estimate 4000 people have saved about �7 each (based on the the Halfords price for changing light bulbs). That's a total of �28,000! Imagine that reflected in your organisation... [youtube]0VaPOtC-Ans[/youtube]
