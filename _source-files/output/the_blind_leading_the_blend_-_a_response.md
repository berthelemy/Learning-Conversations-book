# The blind leading the blend - a response {#the-blind-leading-the-blend-a-response}

_Date posted: 30 September 2009_

This post was stimulated by Norman Lamont's article: [The blind leading the blend](http://normanlamont.typepad.com/eellearning/2009/09/the-blind-leading-the-blend.html). The comment got too long, so I've turned it into its own post here: Norman, I agree with your analysis that people tend not to go through materials prior to "the big day". One way to minimise that is to make delegates actually do some work prior to the event. Eg. an assessment, prepare a case study etc. Then make it really clear that they will be expected to present/talk about their work on the Big Day. I've done it both ways - using prior materials, and using forums etc afterwards. Whether they work depends totally on the context in which you're working:

1.  What are the learner's expectations? How are they set?
2.  What level of e-confidence do the learners have? That's not just IT confidence, but their confidence in communicating online.
3.  What are their manager's expectations - particularly around use of time for learning?

If you are looking at using computer mediated communication, whether forums or blogs, then the following may be very useful: http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml - Gilly Salmon's model for getting a learning group working online. To make it work you must not skip stages 1 and 2. http://docs.google.com/View.aspx?docid=ag9j97p7pg73_ahh5gqp63qx4 - A document created by Terry Anderson (Athabasca Uni) and Donna Cameron, providing a set of ideas for "Collaborative Learning Activities Using Social Software Tools"
