# Online learning: how not to do it {#online-learning-how-not-to-do-it}

Learning to study as an adult is a tricky process. You have to get to grips with the subject matter of what you're studying. You have to understand which particular referencing styles will work for your particular institution. You have to relearn how to write academic essays. Part of the role of the institution is to provide [scaffolding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding) that will support the student as they develop their confidence, skills and knowledge. As time goes by, that scaffolding can be removed. For now, however, let's just consider what would happen if, instead of scaffolding, you provided experiences that are guaranteed to generate demoralization, frustration and reduced confidence. What might those experiences look like?

1.  An introductory booklet to your online systems (library and virtual learning environment) that was clearly out-of-date and didn't match up with the students' experiences of those systems.
2.  No clear signposts to get directly to the online library from your university homepage.
3.  Provide links to online library items that are organised by whether they are a book, a journal, a newspaper or a multimedia resource. When you don't know what you're looking for, that's guaranteed to confuse.
4.  Provide links to multiple catalogues and search engines, none of which will actually help you find anything that you can use
5.  Make sure that the search system you provide (yes, [EBSCO](http://search.ebscohost.com/), I'm looking at you!) is so slow as to be almost unusable.
6.  For any books or papers that you do actually provide online - make sure that they can only be viewed by downloading one page pdf's at a time. (This might work better in IE, if you've got it set up to display pdf's in the browser window - but that's really not guaranteed, and certainly isn't default behaviour in Firefox)
7.  If your student's decide to use systems like they're used to - ie. Google Scholar - don't let them get them get to any of the "private" content. Opt out of the [Athens](http://www.athens.ac.uk/) system so they have to come back to your closed library system, which they can't use.
8.  Tell your students that they will have to do lots of reading around their subject.

Follow these simple rules and your success will be guaranteed. (Based on a true, present-day experience)
