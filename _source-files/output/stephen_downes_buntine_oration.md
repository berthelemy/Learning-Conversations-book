This is a key paper that discusses how bringing together a number of "unstructured" internet technologies (RSS, Blogs & Google) can support the learning needs of today, by providing true learning networks, which create "order out of chaos." He compares this to the current focus on learning objects, federated searches, learning design & learning management systems, and how these provide an "inadequate model" for learning online. The only issue I have here, is that the [Munimall](http://www.munimall.net/index.nclk) illustration he gives, of an "open-ended learning environment", does not seem to live up to this description. In fact, its use of WebCT to provide online courses and classes seems to illustrate everything he is trying to move away from.
