# Twitter as your main learning tool? I still don't get it {#twitter-as-your-main-learning-tool-i-still-don-t-get-it}

For two years now, Jane Hart's collation of the [Top 100 Tools for Learning](http://c4lpt.co.uk/top-tools/top-100-tools-for-learning-2011/) has had Twitter in the number 1 spot.  And any number of "learning technology" people will tell you it's their most important tool.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but I just don't get it.

Twitter is a micro-sharing website - which means I can share a statement containing a maximum of 140 characters. That statement can contain links to other sites, plain words, links to other people (known as @mentions) and links to topics (known as hash tags or #tags).

Topics are created organically. A group of people agrees to use a particular #tag and then make sure each of their posts contain that tag.

Users can "follow" other people and see everything they're posting, or they can follow particular #tags. They can use either the Twitter website to do this, or any number of desktop or mobile applications - many of which allow you to be quite sophisticated in how you organise what you follow. (eg. [Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/)).

Twitter users have developed a number of abbreviations, which have now become adopted into the way the system works. For example, RT means ReTweet - ie. you are taking someone's post and pushing it out to the people that follow you.

The two characteristics of Twitter are:

1.  Posts can only be 140 characters long
2.  Posts appear as a stream. If you're not watching at the time a post appears, you'll probably miss it unless it gets retweeted later.

To my mind, Twitter is great for those quick "around the watercooler" conversations. Those ones that happen by chance, when you're in the same time and place as someone else (although with Twitter it relies on one person initially posting something that _might_ be of interest to their followers - they've got no idea of who might be listening at the time - so it's a slightly different situation to a face-to-face conversation).

It's also great for pre-planned conversations, that are fixed to a particular time, and usually led by someone who asks a short series of questions. These questions often stimulate further discussion.

As a learning tool, Twitter does have some uses. But it has some serious disadvantages too:

*   conversations can get very frustrating due to the 140 character limit. Many's the time when I've given up on a debate just because I couldn't say what I needed to in the space available.
*   it's a synchronous tool. If I'm not on Twitter at the right time I will miss what's being said. This has the side-effect of making Twitter (like Facebook) a highly addictive activity.
*   finding a Tweet (a Twitter post) at a later date is nigh on impossible. Google doesn't help - because Tweets are so ephemeral, and no-one links to them, they are rarely, if ever, picked up by the Google search algorithm.

### The Alternative? {#the-alternative}

I learn from the people around me, whether in the office, or from my wider network around the world. They are my personal subject matter experts. It's important to me that I keep up-to-date with thinking in my field (whatever that might be today!)

But I don't have the time or inclination to keep an eye out on Twitter for posts from each particular person. And, with each post being so short, they don't usually contain enough meat for me to get a real idea for what that person is trying to say.

So, my professional network takes two forms:

1.  People who think through what they're trying to say and present those thoughts through a piece of work that's taken some effort to produce. It might be a few paragraphs in a blog, or a video, or an infographic. The key thing is that those works sit in my [RSS Reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) until such a time as I'm ready to use them. At which point I can mark them as read, tag them for filing, make notes on them, or send them to an email address.
2.  People who I'm connected with on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/). Then, if I need to find someone to answer a question, I've usually got a very good idea of who is the best person. Unlike Twitter, which gives you very little space to tell anything about who you are.

Now, there may be people that have got to this article through the auto-tweet that my blog makes. That's great. I'm really pleased you happened to be using Twitter at the same time as the auto-tweet came through. But, if you were away from Twitter and didn't have any other means of being notified about the article, then you would have missed it.

When I started blogging, in pre-Twitter days, there wasn't a place to quickly share odd links to stuff, so I put them on my blog. Gradually though, these were replaced by longer articles like this one - far more useful to me (as they help me to crystallise my own thinking), and, I hope, far more useful to the few people that followed the blog.

With the wholesale move of learning professionals to Twitter, I think we've lost out a lot of the practice of learning - which is about research, analysis, synthesis and depth of conversation - stuff that you just can't do in 140 characters.

I'm still part of the froth and bubble that is Twitter - it provides a useful insight into what people are thinking about at that particular moment in time, and is an easy place to share links to things that might be of interest to others. But to name it my number one learning tool? No. I don't think so.
