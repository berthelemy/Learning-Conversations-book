This paper from the [Global Learning Alliance](http://www.glaworld.com/) discusses:

> The use of electronic performance support to sustain learning, development and support for tasks, procedures and enterprise processes: a functional and financial study for managers.

It continues the push towards "informal learning", but emphasises that we are not talking about online help:

> The problem with on line help systems is that the software is presented and explained outside the context of the task. Context gives explanations meaning and ensures that workers with queries a) resolve them quickly and b) learn and retain new skills for the future. So, learning is not only about content but also about context.
