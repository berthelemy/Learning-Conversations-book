# Understanding networks: two perspectives... {#understanding-networks-two-perspectives}

_Date posted: 23 January 2007_

I hadn't planned this, but the two posts I made yesterday:

*   [edublogs: The importance of creating a network](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/01/22/edublogs_the_importance_of_creating_a_ne)
*   [SCoPE: Seminars: Knowing Knowledge](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/01/22/scope_seminars_knowing_knowledge)

are coming at networks from two different angles, both of which are vital if we're to a) understand networks within and across organisations, and b) make use of them. The first perspective is that of the individual within the network. There are many people who realise that they are part of a networked world, and understand that they need to take responsibility for their part within it. But this group is still very much a minority. [Tom Haskins](http://growchangelearn.blogspot.com/), in his comment, describes them as the "early adopters" - the people who are willing to try new things, and to see the potential benefits rapidly. So, there's a job to do here - to "sell" the benefits of networked learning to those "slow adopters" who cannot yet see the benefit it, as compared to the cost. The second perspective is that of the organisation, which by not engaging with the network is losing contact with those early adopters who are moving far more rapidly than the organisation can deal with. Again, there's a selling job to be done - to persuade organisations that engaging with, and becoming part of, the network is worthwhile. So, what would be on your marketing materials for networked learning for these two audiences?
