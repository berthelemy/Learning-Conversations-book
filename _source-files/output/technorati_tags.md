Perhaps we need to forget complex metadata schema. Most people generating information don't want the hassle of complying anyway. Technorati's software can pull simple tags from blogs, [Flikr](http://flikr.com/) & [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and generate cross-site tag based searches. I'll wait and see if it's as useful & workable as it looks.
