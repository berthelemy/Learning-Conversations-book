# A Chartered Institute for Teaching? {#a-chartered-institute-for-teaching}

_Date posted: 18 January 2011_

In the last week, I've spent a fair bit of time talking with colleagues from the education sector.

One of the topics of discussion was teacher professional development, and how we might encourage teachers to take more responsibility for their own learning.

I would contend that any profession worth that name will have continuing professional development at its core. It will be a requirement for remaining a member of that profession.

Not so with teaching (at least in England). The [General Teaching Council for England](http://www.gtce.org.uk/), although being the government-sponsored professional body, has not dared to challenge the unions by imposing professional development requirements on membership. (NB. I'm not anti-union. I was in the [NUT](http://www.teachers.org.uk/) whilst teaching. But sometimes they have too much power to block things that shouldn't be blocked.)

The political will is obviously not there to address this challenge centrally. So, I would propose that, just like the [CIPD](http://www.cipd.co.uk/) (for HR specialists) and [ALT](http://www.alt.ac.uk/) (for Learning Technologists), there should be a Chartered Institute for Teaching (CIT).

Membership would be voluntary, but, over time, such membership would become the badge of choice for a teacher who was committed to their own professional development. The long term goal would be for membership to become a recognised requirement for a teaching post.

Unlike CIPD, I don't see this organisation providing courses or qualifications. Instead it would provide a service whereby teachers could maintain a record of their professional development ï¿½ choosing to publish some of it as a public portfolio.

By CPD, I don't just mean courses. There's a massive range of CPD opportunities available to teachers, if they would just engage with them.

Professions, such as law, accountancy, medicine etc, all allow their members to maintain records of the CPD hours they have undertaken. I would propose a subtly different model. Instead of measuring the time taken, a better measure would be the amount of thought and effort put in.

The table below is a starting point for such a framework. It will need refinement, I'm sure.

Let's say that to maintain membership in the CIT, teachers need to have achieved 200 CPD points in any 12 month period (measured on a rolling basis). Points can be gained in the following ways:

| Activity | Points awarded | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Post a tweet tagged with #cpd | 1 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 50 points. |
| Write a blog post tagged with #cpd | 10 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points. |
| Publish a podcast or video tagged with #cpd | 20 | Collected automatically, and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio. Up to a maximum of 100 points. |
| Present at a Teachmeet or similar conference | 30 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Organise a Teachmeet or similar conference | 30 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Attend a Teachmeet or other organised CPD event | 5 | Added by the teacher and displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Publish the results of Action Research in a recognised journal (perhaps even one published by the CIT?) | 50 | Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |
| Achieve 30 points at Post-Graduate level | 100 | Added manually by the member, and checked by CIT staff. Displayed on the teacher's CPD portfolio if they wish. |

The more points you gain over 200, the greater the level of membership. So 200 points gives you member status, whilst 300 would give Advanced status etc.

The rationale I'm working on is that sharing knowledge should be rewarded, and the more thought that has gone into that, the greater the reward.

As I say, the model needs to be refined, and gaps filled in. I'd welcome any feedback ...

a) Do you think a Chartered Institute of Teaching has a future?

b) Do you agree with the membership model

c) Do you agree with the points model?

d) Which of these funding sources would be most viable: freemium (some free services, with benefits for paid-up members), commercial sponsorship, government (as if!) - to be honest I'd like to avoid government funding with all the constraints that puts on things.

e) I envisage this as a non-profit making organisation - with transparency in all aspects at its heart. Would that work for you?
