Interesting review of Moodle in use from Bath University. This is the most telling comment:

> Auricle readers will undoubtedly have noticed that although Moodle is in this article's title it has hardly been mentioned. One of Moodle's greatest strengths is that it appears not to get in the way of designing a course to suit what the developers want rather than have to shoe horn it into an environment that substantially changes how the course is delivered. I'm not saying Moodle does not have its limitations, but it largely does what it says on the box (if it had one:) If you wish to deliver courses that support a student centred approach then this is what it does. The software installation does not raise any problems and customisation, as mentioned earlier, is straightforward, even for people with limited programming experience. The support from the wider Moodle community is quite exceptional with answers to most of the questions to be found in the extensive forums that exist at the moodle Web site. Questions posted to the forums often produce responses within hours of it going live.
