# A model for continuing professional development {#a-model-for-continuing-professional-development}

_Date posted: 16 January 2011_

Over the past few years, I have gained enormously by listening to, and engaging with a number of communities of practice; within teaching, higher education and workplace training. Existing on the boundaries of these communities has allowed me to bring ideas from different sectors into whichever job I find myself doing. Whilst at the [Collaborate for Change](http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/32996820/Collabor8-4-Change-at-BETT-2011) event last week (also, see [Zoe Ross's review](http://www.zoeross.com/2011/01/14/c84c-more-please/)), I spent a fair bit of time talking with people about teacher professional development. But, actually, the ideas being generated apply equally to almost any other profession or community of practice.

### Motivation ï¿½ the key {#motivation-the-key}

The key underlying factor for any successful professional development model is motivation. I spent a long time, whilst working as a teacher, expecting my school or local authority to provide whatever professional development it thought I needed. It was only when I moved to the corporate world, into an environment where responsibility for your actions (and your mistakes) was devolved as far down as possible, that I discovered the need (and the benefits) of taking responsibility for my own learning. That's a long process though, and depends very much on an enabling culture of both management and financial decision-making. Either that, or it depends on mavericks; people who take responsibility for themselves, simply because they know it's the best way to improve what they do. Alongside that bottom-up driven professional development, there need to be some external motivating factors that will help reluctant learners to take responsibility for their own development. These might include:

*   Recognition
*   Increased pay
*   Better chances of promotion

### A deepening framework {#a-deepening-framework}

I have had the chance to observe, and take part in, a number of professional development opportunities. Some have been incredibly useful, others less so. The list below comes from these experiences. As you move down the list, the depth of learning possible becomes greater. Basically, the more you put into an experience, the more you will get out of it.

1.  Watching a presentation, listening to a talk or lecture
2.  Taking an active part in a conversation where you have to argue a point, both online or offline. There are a number of models for this, such as [Fishbowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_%28conversation%29), [Study Circles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_circle), [Action Learning Sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning), and table top conversations (like we did at Collaborate for Change)
3.  Producing and sharing resources to support other professionals
4.  Reflecting on input that you have experienced
5.  Reflecting on that input in public, and responding to feedback

This is an extreme simplification of some much better thought out models, such as [Gilly Salmon's 5 stage model](http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml) (which was designed for online learning, but applies equally well to any context where the aim is to encourage deep professional development).
