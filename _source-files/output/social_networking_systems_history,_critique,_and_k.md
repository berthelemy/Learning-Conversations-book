A very useful critique of the current state of social networking systems.

> The profusion of SNS sites and applications that have appeared in the past few years demonstrates a palpable interest in social networking applications by virtue of user demand. Social networks have been augmented by technology for some time, but now sufficient numbers of people have access to online resources such that the need for the technology to serve the social needs of its users is clear. The first generation of SNS applications has done much to justify the need for such services, as well as identified what must be improved in order to make the technology more useful. A unification of effort amongst the competing SNS applications is needed, as is a movement towards support for open protocols for access to its services and information. With further attention given to integration with existing technologies, SNS could greatly improve personal and organizational knowledge management.
