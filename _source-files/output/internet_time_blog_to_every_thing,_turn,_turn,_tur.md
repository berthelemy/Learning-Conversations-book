I've already referred to this in my notes on [Scott Wilson's posting](http://www.cetis.ac.uk/members/scott/blogview?entry=20050418075918) about it, but I think the graph showing how formal & informal learning methods can help learners is very telling. "Novices learn best through formal learning, for it provides the structure, signposts, and scaffolding a newby lacks. Old hands learn best informally, because they already have foundation knowledge, familiarity, and a framework for understanding. The reverse of these observations is also true. Put novices in totally informal learning situations, and they'll become confused and not get much out of them. Put experienced people in a class, and they will rebel because so much of it is redundant."
