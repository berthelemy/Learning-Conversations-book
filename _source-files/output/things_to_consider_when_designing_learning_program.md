# Things to consider when designing learning programmes {#things-to-consider-when-designing-learning-programmes}

_Date posted: 28 November 2005_

The following came from a group brainstorm at work and has since been severely pruned by me. We were looking at the process by which a learning programme to meet a specific learning need might be designed. Normally we tend to look immediately at the resources we need. However, until learning designers (and clients) understand the new, online world of learning as well as the old, offline world, we will always need to take them through a couple of stages beforehand: _Consider the context:_ Cultural: What is the CPD culture in your LA? What do people respond to well? What works and is effective? Infrastructure: What is in place that can be used to support CPD? eg. Network meetings, teacher centre, internet-based communication and collaboration tools. What access do the learners have to this infrastructure? What resources already exist? Management: Is school management supportive of CPD? How is CPD funded? How is time allocated? What cultural, infrastructure and management constraints are you working within? _Consider the activities your learners might do:_ When designing your learning programme it's important to take into account the theories that attempt to model how learning works: behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism, connectivism et al. The activities that your learners will do will be influenced strongly by the ways you believe people learn, and also by the context in which the learning is to take place (see above). Some example activities:

|   | Online | Not online |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individual | Find answers to questions Read Post messages to individuals Post messages to groups Ask questions Post messages to the world Be tested Play games Watch video and multimedia / TV Listen to Radio / audio interview/discussion Talk to others | Write a journal Write an article Write a report Write a Journal Write an article Write a report Listen to a Podcasts on mp3 player Shadow another person Read Be tested Build something Watch a demonstration or something being modelled Watch TV Listen to the radio Find answers to questions |
| Group | Participate in online discussion Teleconference Email Chat Write collaboratively Create media Play games | Thought showers Colleagues coaching Training sessions Presentations Conferences / video / telephone conferences Create media Participate in discussion Listen to Lecture Practical experiments Games Role play Drama activity Practice |

_Consider the resources you may need to support those activities:_ The activities you choose will need resourcing, maybe with personnel, with an environment in which they are to take place, with media, or with design tools with which to create or aggregate new media. Your choice will be influenced by the context in which the learning is to take place, particularly the existing resources already available to you. Some example resources:

|   | Online | Not online |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personnel | Forum facilitator (e-moderator) Content manager Administrator Mentor IT support Friends Learning designer (instructional design) Teacher Chat group Network Expert Editor Learners | Administrator Teacher Facilitator Coach Mentor Trainer Teaching assistant Parent / siblings Friends LEA advisor Department Learners Editor |
| Media | PDF Hypertext mp3 (audio) mp4 (video) Images / graphics Diary Sequential learning module Presentation (webcast) Animation Blog Game space email Quizzes web forms | Book Magazine Newsletter DVD (video) DVD Rom Radio TV Poster CD-Rom Worksheet Powerpoint presentation Letters Phone calls Books Course materials Print Interactive CD/DVD rom Exam papers |
| Environment | Wiki Blog Podcast Learning Management System Forum Chat room Video-conferencing Audio-conferencing WWW Intranet LAN Network Moodle e-classroom computer lab / office / home | Meeting room Classroom Coffee bar Pub Park Car park Training room Museum Bedroom Library Conference Group Hobbies Life |
| Design tools | Word Powerpoint HTML editor Audio recorder / editor Video editing Wiki Blog RSS aggregator (eg. SuperGlu) | Desktop Publishing Word Powerpoint Flash Windows PhotoStory Windows MovieMaker |

By no means is this a definitive list. It's very much a work in progress.
