## Rule 5: Is it sustainable? {#rule-5-is-it-sustainable}

It's all about the money - how will you be reasonably sure that development will continue? With closed-source software it's usually quite easy to determine how the software development is funded. Funding models for open-source development vary widely. But you need to make sure it�s going to happen somehow. Information Week has identified [five open-source business models](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/01/the_five_open_s.html):

*   Sell support services
*   Build (or run) hardware that uses your software
*   Sell proprietary (closed-source) software that complements the open-source code
*   Sell closed-source licenses for customers who prefer not to be bound by the open-source license conditions
*   Sell advertising space

The most popular model by far is that of selling services. Usually it works like this:

1.  Initial code is created by a core team for their own purposes - often using chunks of code from other open-source projects
2.  The code is released as open-source and other people start to use it - often feeding back bugs, ideas, or additional bits of code - the "wisdom of crowds"
3.  Larger users may set up their own development teams to work with the code - these usually feed code back into the Core team.
4.  Experts in the software (including the Core team) may offer services such as consultancy, hosting, customisation or configuration
5.  Sometimes the Core team may have formal accreditation arrangements with service providers which means the Core get a share of any revenue.

The more popular an application, often the more formalised the development and accreditation processes become - such is the case with Moodle. If there is no apparent business model for an application, then it may be that it�s being developed by enthusiasts, who want to make use of the "wisdom of crowds" effect inherent in open-source development. If you want to be reasonably certain that development will continue, then you need to play a part in the ecology. That might mean purchasing services from organisations that feed into the development cycle. Or it might mean contributing towards the development cycle yourselves:

*   Producing chunks of code
*   Testing pre-release versions
*   Supporting other users in the forums
*   Producing documentation
*   Feeding back on bugs and issues

Did you know that Microsoft themselves funded the part of Moodle that enables it to connect it with Microsoft�s SQL Server, Oracle & other databases out of the box? (Source: Moodle.org)

### The open source advantage {#the-open-source-advantage}

Open-source software has a complex set of business models - which don't always sit comfortably alongside more a commercial cash-based economy. However it does mean that you can contribute to the ecology without necessarily having lots of cash.
