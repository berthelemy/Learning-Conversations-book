## Rule 1: Will it do what you want it to do? {#rule-1-will-it-do-what-you-want-it-to-do}

That should be the easiest thing to work out. You come up with a set of requirements and the application vendor lets you know which of those things it will do. Of course, life�s never as simple as that. I�ve seen far too many requirements that focus entirely on a list of functionality, with no regard for how that functionality is actually implemented within the software. So you could end up with a tool that will do everything you want it to, but no-one will be able to use it. There are three approaches to finding out whether software will actually do what you need:

1.  Find someone who knows the software who can look at your requirements and explain how the tool will work in your context
2.  Read up all the product documentation that is available
3.  Try it out on a small scale

### The open-source advantage {#the-open-source-advantage}

With closed-source software you are usually tied to the vendor to get information about the product. Some vendors are excellent at providing information and demonstration versions to look at. Many are less so. Many vendors are happy to send a salesperson to see you - but usually they are biased towards the product. With open-source software you'll may need to pay a consultant if you want someone to demonstrate the software and understand your requirements (particularly with a complex application). But at least you are more likely to get an independent view on things. Also, with open-source software, there is nothing to stop you taking it and trying it out on any scale. Although you must remember that the more people are using it, and the more you rely on it, the more likely it is that you'll need professional help to use it well. That does depend very much on the type of application though.
