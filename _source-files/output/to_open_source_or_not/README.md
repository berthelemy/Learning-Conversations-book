# To open source or not? {#to-open-source-or-not}

_This is a high-level summary of a talk I'm giving at Learning Technologies 2009 at the end of this month. If you're coming along then use it to help you prepare some questions..._ Open source learning software means more than just [Moodle](http://moodle.org/). As well as the ubiquitous LMS, there are open source content development tools (e.g. [ExeLearning](http://exelearning.org/)), mind-mapping applications (e.g. [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)), audio-editing tools (eg. [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)), utilities (e.g. [Filezilla](http://filezilla-project.org/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)), content management systems (e.g. [Etomite](http://www.etomite.org/) and [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/)), and even [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/), a full-blown competitor to Microsoft Office. All of these, and many other open-source applications, are potentially useful for learning professionals - but how do you know that these open-source applications are going to work in your organisation?
