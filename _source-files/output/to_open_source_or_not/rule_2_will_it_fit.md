## Rule 2: Will it fit? {#rule-2-will-it-fit}

What existing systems will the new software need to work with? Will it work on your servers? Will you need additional server expertise or hardware? Where will you get that from? Will it need to look like existing systems? Who will do that? Will it need to collect data from your existing systems? Can your existing systems provide the data in a compatible format? Will it need to supply data to your existing systems? Can it do that already, or will you need additional coding?

### The open source advantage {#the-open-source-advantage}

In general, the major open source projects try to follow recognised standards and practices in coding and in linking to other applications. There's no advantage to keeping data inside your particular application; strength is gained by the number of ways you can connect to other development teams and applications.
