# Dissertation Survey: Update (or why so many partial responses?) {#dissertation-survey-update-or-why-so-many-partial-responses}

_Date posted: 6 August 2007_

I'm interested to know why so many (80%) of the responses to my dissertation survey ([survey details from this post](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/07/21/dissertation_survey)) have not been completed. The pattern seems to be that:

1.  People look at it and then decide it's not for them at all - I wonder why they looked in the first place?
2.  People do the easy (multi-choice) questions, but not the text-based ones (which are the ones that will be most useful) - I wonder whether it's taking over the 15 minutes I said it would?
3.  People complete the survey, but don't send in their OPML file. I wonder if that's because of privacy concerns or through not knowing how to get it?

If you have not yet completed the survey, please could I encourage you to do so - and to mention it on your blog or in your social network group. I am hoping that the results will be useful to anyone who is looking to see how to use blogs and RSS to promote large-scale communities of practice. Thanks in advance.
