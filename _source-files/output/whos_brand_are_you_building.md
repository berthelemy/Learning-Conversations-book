# Who's brand are you building? {#who-s-brand-are-you-building}

_Date posted: 5 January 2012_

If you self-publish, whether on a blog, a Youtube channel, on Twitter or even books and ebooks, then who owns the brand that you're building? You, or the organisation you're associated with? The [BBC](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2011/jun/22/laura-kuenssberg-twitter-account) and [Phonedog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16338040) have recently had to address this, with regards to Twitter accounts "owned" by personalities within their organisations. It's a difficult question to answer without a specific context, but I'd like to offer a few guiding principles that might help protect both the individual and their organisation. As always, I'd welcome any feedback to help refine these...

### For the individual {#for-the-individual}

1.  Don't mention the organisation you are associated with anywhere on your personally published materials
2.  Put a disclaimer on your materials along the lines of:

    > Disclaimer: The contents of this website do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employer nor any other organisation with which I am associated.

3.  Don't publish anything that is going to cause any embarrassment to your organisation. If in doubt - ask before publishing. It's very hard to retract things.

### For the organisation {#for-the-organisation}

1.  Use more than one author on your blog, Twitter account etc
2.  Don't use an individual's name on your blog/Twitter account unless you have a clear agreement with the individual that they will lose control of these accounts if they move to a different organisation. This is especially true for public systems like Twitter.
3.  Have a clear distinction between personal publishing and corporate publishing, with policies that release individuals to publish, whilst protecting the organisation.
