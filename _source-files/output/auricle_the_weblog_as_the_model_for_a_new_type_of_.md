Derek Morrison looks at ELGG - Edinburgh University prototype VLE, which combines a weblog, social networking, syndication, and resource sharing. He notes it's a "user-centric environment", but it needs some refinement - mainly around the way it handles resources (to reduce the number of duplicate files being stored), and the way it handles aggregation (so that users aren't "overwhelmed" by postings). It's worth keeping an eye on. And it will become open-source (hurray!)
