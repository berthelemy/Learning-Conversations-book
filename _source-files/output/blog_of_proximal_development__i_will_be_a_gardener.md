Konrad Glogowski describes how his classroom blogging community has developed over the past year, and how he has realised the need to cultivate that community. He quotes [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/bio.html) who says that "[To create an environment conducive to real community, you will have to operate more like a gardener than an architect](http://shirky.com/writings/broadcast_and_community.html)".
