This [podcast](http://k12online.wm.edu/McIntoshK12.m4a) (15Mb) is a well thought out description of the approach in Scotland to using new technologies to support teacher CPD, and the implications of using those technologies. The podcast is supported by a [blog post](http://k12onlineconference.org/?p=58), and was produced as part of the K12 Online Conference in 2006. [Ewan](http://edu.blogs.com/) works for [Learning & Teaching Scotland](http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/)
