Terry Freedman has written an interesting analysis of some of the reasons why British (is it just British?) teachers don't appear to have taken on some of the new ideas of blogging / wikis etc in their classrooms. The biggest issue seems to be one of _time..._ Why, when we are trying to help our children reflect on their own learning (ie. the Assessment for Learning agenda), do we not build into our own professional learning time to reflect...? Blogging provides a brilliant mechanism for this - as it allows you to then connect with other like-minded people.
