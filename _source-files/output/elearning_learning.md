You may have noticed the little badge on the right of this blog that says I'm one of [elearninglearning.com](http://www.elearninglearning.com/)'s featured writers.

Elearning Learning brings together content from leading experts and companies like the [Adobe Captivate Blog](http://www.elearninglearning.com/&source=adobe-captivate-blog), [Clark Quinn](http://www.elearninglearning.com/&source=clark-quinn), [Clive Shepherd](http://www.elearninglearning.com/&source=clive-on-learning), [Jay Cross](http://www.elearninglearning.com/&source=jay-cross), [Karl Kapp](http://www.elearninglearning.com/&source=kapp-notes), and many others. You can find a long list of the Featured sources on the right hand side of the [ElearningLearning](http://www.elearninglearning.com/) home page.  There is also a lot more content that comes in as well beyond the Featured sources.

They've recently launched some new features, to make it even more useful, so I'd recommend taking a look.

The home page itself will show you the latest and best content at any time.

"Best" is decided by the system based on [social signals](http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2009/06/using-social-signals-to-find-top.html) - that's clicks, views, twitter, delicious, and other kinds of inputs that tell us what people are doing with the content.  And the team try to make sure that great content from lesser known sources still makes it to the top.

Each day, week, month and year, the site generates a "Best Of" Edition.  You can change the Edition at any time.  That allows you to see some really great stuff looking a little more broadly than what you typically see on the home page.

The site is categorized in various topics such as concepts like [Instructional Design](http://www.elearninglearning.com/instructional-design/), [Mobile](http://www.elearninglearning.com/mobile/), [Social Learning](http://www.elearninglearning.com/social-learning/); tools like [Twitter](http://www.elearninglearning.com/twitter/), [LMS](http://www.elearninglearning.com/lms/), [Flash](http://www.elearninglearning.com/flash/), [PowerPoint](http://www.elearninglearning.com/powerpoint/), [Captivate](http://www.elearninglearning.com/captivate/); Companies like [Rapid Intake](http://www.elearninglearning.com/rapid-intake/), [Saba](http://www.elearninglearning.com/saba/); types like [Examples](http://www.elearninglearning.com/examples/) and many more.

The intent of eLearning Learning is to bring together and make it easy to find great content.  You will only see a snippet of each piece.  When you click the link, you will be directed back to the source.  In other words, they bring the content together, but don't own the content.  They want you still to comment and interact with the content back on the original site - which, from an author's point of view is much preferred!

You can subscribe to the site by entering your email address and then choosing whether you want a Daily Edition or Weekly/Monthly/Annual Edition to be sent to you.  Or you can subscribe in your chosen RSS reader.
