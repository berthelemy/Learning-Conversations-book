By obsolete, I mean that our high schools - even when they are working as designed - cannot teach our kids what they need to know today." * "Training the workforce of tomorrow with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about today's computers on a 50 year old mainframe." * "Only 1/3 of our students graduate from high school ready for college, work and citizenship." * Gates suggests 3 new "R"'s for redesigned high schools: Rigor, Relevance and Relationships (with mentoring adults). * Gates is urging, and backing these perspectives with grants from his foundation of $1 Billion, focusing on smaller schools, different forms of measurement and greater commitment to getting ALL students across the finish line in terms of readiness for college, work and citizenship.
