If you want to get people to use systems then there are a few things you can do:

*   Make it the only way they can get things to happen. Eg. claiming expenses
*   Make sure it fits in with other systems they already use. Eg. email, SMS
*   Make sure it provides plenty of hand-holding when they first use it. Eg. [SocialCast](https://www.socialcast.com/features/)
*   Make sure they understand how it can help them. If it's not obvious, then market it.
*   Make it simple to get to and to get started.
*   Make sure that the message about the system can spread virally
*   Make sure you keep your potential champions on board at all stages of choosing and designing the system.
*   Talk to your users about how they're using it

And here's how to stifle adoption:

*   Keep your champions and users at arms' length
*   Use language in the interface that only a few people understand
*   Make sure all the messages about the system's benefits are centrally driven
