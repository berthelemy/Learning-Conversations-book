I know it's odd to link to your own blog posts, but I'm starting a series of blog posts on CPD Connections which are intended to stimulate the site a bit. The series will focus on people who are using blogs & blogging to support their own CPD (Continuing Professional Development). As this is likely to be the subject of my dissertation, I am hoping to develop the series by including interviews, questionnaire results & surveys which will form the basis of my research into social networking and CPD. At some point, when I upgrade the Elgg software, I'll be able to post things here and have them duplicated into CPD Connections, but for the moment they are two separate systems.
