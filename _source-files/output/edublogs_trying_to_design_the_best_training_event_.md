# edublogs: Trying to design the best training event we can {#edublogs-trying-to-design-the-best-training-event-we-can}

There is a lot that we in England can learn from our colleagues across the border in Scotland... particularly when it comes to professional development structures for our teachers. Ewan describes in [this post](http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/trying_to_desig.html) the elements that _he_ tries to include within any CPD event that he runs. It includes:

> *   Ensuring the the training backup materials are online;
> *   Ensuring that participants can edit and add to the materials with their anecodotes, and help each other out even though they work in different locations;
> *   Ensuring participants have his blog and mobile phone number as a safetynet;
> *   Ensuring that participants could see from the training notes what their next steps might be in terms of training.

Some people would describe this approach as "blended". I'm gradually turning more and more away from that term towards the word "connected". What Ewan is showing here is how to make sure that the CPD opportunity at the event connects with other CPD back at school, or at a later date. But also, using the technologies available it allows people to connect with each other, and, via people's blogs, with other ideas. This is where the learning theory known as [Connectivism](http://www.connectivism.ca/) hits the road and gets put into practice.
