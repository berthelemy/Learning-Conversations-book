# "We could change everything" {#we-could-change-everything}

_Date posted: 19 January 2011_

Sugata Mitra, on typically inspiring form, demonstrates what can be achieved by providing motivated children access to content and people. Some of the results appear almost miraculous. They are discussed in detail in his recent BJET paper: [Limits to self-organising systems of learningï¿½the Kalikuppam experiment](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01077.x/abstract). (It's a pity that, for a Becta-funded journal, you still need a paid subscription!) He talks about the "granny effect" - having someone looking over the child's shoulder, asking questions about what they're doing, and enthusing about it. I loved his description of the model he used in Gateshead:

*   Four children working together on a computer.
*   Children can change teams.
*   No child should work alone.
*   Children can observe other teams and bring back knowledge to their own team.

Has anyone seen this model working in their classrooms?
