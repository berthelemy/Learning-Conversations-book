# A 21st Century LMS conceptual model {#a-21st-century-lms-conceptual-model}

_Date posted: 4 February 2011_

Early stages yet, but I'm working on a conceptual model for the 21st Century LMS. The diagram below shows the high-level view. There's a lot of detail that sits underneath it, which I'm not able to publish yet. Any comments very gratefully welcomed...[![21st Century LMS Conceptual Model](./assets/new_lms_conceptual_model.png)](./assets/new_lms_conceptual_model.png)
