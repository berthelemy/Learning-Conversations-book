# Show me inexpensive learning interventions that work {#show-me-inexpensive-learning-interventions-that-work}

Alongside the eLearning Network's [Campaign for Effective Elearning](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning), I propose that we also need to be highlighting any learning interventions that really work. And by "work", I don't mean ones that necessarily use state-of-the-art technologies and high quality graphics. They might look good to the people paying the bills, but are they really what is needed to solve the problem? I mean the interventions that are being produced on a daily basis by learning professionals (and those who aren't professionals - where they are allowed!) To be included in the list, they need to:

1.  Reach maximum audience for minimum cost
2.  Be tested on a realistic sample of real learners
3.  Have made a demonstrable positive difference to the behaviours or skills of those learners

For a start, I'd like to propose my own video how-to on [changing a light bulb in a Ford CMax](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VaPOtC-Ans), and [the analysis I did on its effectiveness](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/01/07/highly-cost-effective-video-based?blog=5). Thanks to [Barry Sampson](http://barrysampson.com/2012/03/this-is-not-showbusiness/) for stimulating this train of thought.
