Just published the first video from the PEEL (Personnel Experts in Employement Law) Club. It was done on a shoestring, with a [Kodak Zi8](http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Zi8_Pocket_Video_Camera/productID.156585800) camera with an Audio Technica ATR microphone. Thanks to [Leon Cych](http://www.l4l.co.uk/) for the kit recommendation. There aren't many low cost cameras that take external microphones. But it's essential for this sort of event where you can't get close to your subject. The editing was done on iMovie 6, with a GarageBand audio clip for the title music. Next time, I'll need to make sure I include some shots of people other than the speaker, as it can get a bit monotonous looking at the same talking head for 13 minutes! (And that's no comment on [Prof. Pat Leighton](http://www.capita-ld.co.uk/courses/Pages/Pat-Leighton.aspx) - even I found what she was saying quite fascinating as she delved into the complexities and implications of the new employment laws) I'd welcome any comments on how to improve the editing / camera work. What you've got here is a 13 minute summary of a 3.5 hour workshop! [youtube]PeOzfVttzJs[/youtube]
