This White Paper (click on the link above then go to the section headed White Papers) formed the basis of my presentations at BETT 2004. However BETT wasn't the place really for in-depth discussion around the educational theory; people wanted to see something whizzy & exciting... so the presentation changed significantly by the end of the week. **Update**: This file has now been removed... :-(
