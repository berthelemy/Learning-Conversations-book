I'm sure this is getting a lot of airplay in the EdTech world. But with Google now offering a free solution for any educational organisation (including with customised logos), why should schools, local authorities etc buy into a VLE? Pretty much everything I can do in a VLE (except for multi-choice assessment tools) is now possible with a Google account. So, technically I now don't need to buy into a VLE. But the decision needs to be based on wider issues than that. The main one being trust... can I trust my service provider to maintain the level of service I need, with the level of privacy and security I require? I'm not sure how Google will do in this market. They're obviously looking for more users on which they can base their highly successful targetted advertising, but how they do that whilst still maintaining the trust of school administrators and teachers remains to be seen.
