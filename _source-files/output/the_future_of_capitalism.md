# The future of capitalism? {#the-future-of-capitalism}

_Date posted: 5 July 2012_

You'd think, given the immense problems seen with capitalism over the past few years, that more people would be up in arms about how our corporate institutions deal with people. I won't pretend to understand very much about how capitalism works, or even much about economics. But I am interested in the beliefs that underpin how our society works, and the effects on society when those beliefs are allowed to work through to their full extent. [Charles Handy's conversation session](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/04/18/reflections-on-a-conversation-with?blog=5) about the Future of Capitalism opened up a few points that left me thinking..., particularly as [I'm now in the market for a private pension](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/06/28/all-change?blog=5). I'm starting to realise that all the options available for investment in a pension are based on market-values; whether it's the current price of the Euro, of gold, or of the price of the shares in a particular company. When you "invest" in these, you're not actually making an investment in the thing itself. This particularly applies to company shares. The money invested in them doesn't go to the company to enable it to grow (except in the case of the initial offer of shares). Instead, you're just making a statement of confidence in the thing you're investing in. Pension funds (one of the main drivers of capitalist thinking and behaviours), through their share ownership, gain a role in the governance of companies, but none of the money invested in the pension actually goes to the company itself. There must be some benefits to this disconnect, but I'm not sure I understand them yet. It does seem that the whole pensions market is just a bit of a gamble, all based on how people "feel" about the market, rather than about genuine economic growth. It would be so much better, in my opinion, if I could invest my pension in schemes or programmes where the money could be used to stimulate growth, to make real products, or generate real benefits for people. For example, personal-lending programmes like ([Zopa](http://uk.zopa.com/) and [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/)). But that's against the pension rules. I think because the HMRC want some level of independent governance that prevents fraudulent tax avoidance. I'm all for that, but there must be a way to make real pension investments that aren't just dependent on the movements of a market value? Any ideas?
