I had the privilege recently of making a podcast with the team from [Xyleme Voices](http://www.xyleme.com/podcasts). From the podcast blurb:

> Mark ... makes the case that companies are spending thousands of dollars on creating training content but they are locking it away in their Learning Management System (LMS). In today�s podcast Mark will be discussing how to get more from your LMS. In the corporate learning context, Mark argues that learners cannot quickly get the information they need because the content they require is sitting inside the company�s LMS without the ability to search for it. Mark explains how the problem lies not with the system itself, but with how it is used in conjunction with other systems and he offers his advice on how corporations can best address this issue in the workplace.

Nothing new from what I've been saying for a while, but the podcast seems to capture things quite succinctly. You can listen to the podcast using the player above, or go to the [Xyleme Voice page](http://www.xyleme.com/podcasts/archives/33) where you can subscribe to the podcast RSS feed.
