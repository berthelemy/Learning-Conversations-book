This 35 minute narrated presentation (originally done for a NAACE conference in 2006) provides a very good overview of how Buckinghamshire are implementing the idea of a Learning Platform based on a range of different but complementary open source and commercial products. The presentation is strongly focussed on the pedagogical, management, and cultural reasons for the decisions that have been made in Bucks. [More information on the BucksGfL Learning Platform](http://www.bucksgfl.org.uk/resources/course/view.php?id=113). If you want to meet up with Ian Usher, who is the guy behind the presentation, he will be at the BETT show this week. [More details](http://moodlea.blogspot.com/2007/01/return-to-naples.html).
