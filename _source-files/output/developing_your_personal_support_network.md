### Teachers teaching teachers {#teachers-teaching-teachers}

Many teachers around the world are sharing ideas using personal webpages (often known as blogs). Take a look at some of the links below. As you look at them, note down your answers to these questions:

| Name of the site | Who is writing? Where are they from? | Why are they writing? (What do they get out of it?) | How often do they update the site? | Is anyone commenting on what they write? |

### RSS (or web feeds) in plain English {#rss-or-web-feeds-in-plain-english}

It's hard work keeping up with what everyone's doing. Especially if you have to go to their website just to see if they've added something new. The video below explains, in three minutes, how using RSS (aka web feeds) can help. [youtube]0klgLsSxGsU[/youtube] The video is from the [Common Craft Show](http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english). A [transcript](http://www.commoncraft.com/rss-video-transcript) is also available. A much larger version (which you can then show offline) is available from [Blip.tv](http://blip.tv/file/get/Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.wmv). Move on to the next page when you are ready.

### Setting up a feed reader {#setting-up-a-feed-reader}

There are a number of ways to set up a feed reader. You could choose to have a program installed on your computer, or you could choose to use one that is web-based. For the purposes of this training session it's easier to start with a web-based reader. At the moment, I recommend Google Reader - the video below gives a quick introduction to it.

### Subscribing to some feeds {#subscribing-to-some-feeds}

There are a number of ways to subscribe to feeds within Google Reader:

*   If you know the address of the feed (often ending in something like /rss.xml) to which you want to subscribe, you can just click on the "Add Subscriptions" link and paste the address in the text field that appears.
*   Some sites, like this one, have an "Add to Google" button ([![Add to Google](./assets/add.gif "Add to Google")](http://fusion.google.com/add?feedurl=http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark?tempskin=_rss2)). If you click on this you will be taken automatically to Google Reader to subscribe.
*   Or you can copy the address of the website and paste it in Google Reader's "Add subscription" box. If there's a feed associated with the page, it will be added to your subscriptions.
*   Or look for a link or a button that indicates a feed is available (eg. ![RSS icon](./assets/feeds_icon.jpg "Feeds icon") ![XML icon](./assets/feeds_rss2.jpg "RSS icon")). Click on this link and copy the contents of the address bar into the Add Subscriptions text box. The page that comes up when you click on the link might look full of strange code but Google Reader will display it properly.

> Start with this site - and subscribe to it. If you use the Add to Google button it will open in a new window. Then pick out some of the websites that interested you from page 1 and subscribe to them.

### Keeping up-to-date {#keeping-up-to-date}

There are lots of other useful sites that produce web feeds that you can subscribe to: Most newspapers and media organisations will syndicate their news as web feeds. Some may even produce different feeds for different categories of news. Many sites (eg. [Guardian job search](http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/index.html), [Google news search](http://news.google.co.uk/), and [Blogdigger](http://www.blogdigger.com/index.html)) will produce a web feed for any search you do. This allows you to automatically pick up new items that are fit your search terms. A lot of the educators listed on page 1 also encourage their pupils to contribute to similar sites. These produce web feeds which allow them to connect with other classes. For example, start with [Paul Harrington's Class 3H site](http://class3hcefnfforest.blogspot.com/), and follow the links to their friends (down on the right hand side). Now you've covered a lot of the practical parts of this workshop, your facilitator will take you through some of the implications of using web feeds to support your professional development and your practice.
