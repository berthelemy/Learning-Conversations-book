If you have any interest in the ways the technology and education can interact then listen to the shows on Worldbridges. The "brainstorms" gather a group of 5 practioners together, from across the world, and across the educational community (from primary school [US=elementary] to college to the workplace) sharing how they've used "EdTech" in their situations and what they're learning. As one of the presenters remarked recently, it's the easiest form of professional development, just listening to, and being inspired by these people.
