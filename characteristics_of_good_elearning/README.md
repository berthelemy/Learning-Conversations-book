# Characteristics of good elearning {#characteristics-of-good-elearning}

You may as well ask "What makes a good book?" when thinking about the characteristics of good elearning. It depends on what it's trying to achieve, who it's aimed at, and the context in which it will be used. Are we talking about a novel, a textbook, a reference, a coffee table book, a children's picture book, etc? Nevertheless, I'm going to try... This thought process started during the recent [Midlands Learning Tweetup](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2012/11/05/midlands-learning-tweetup). During the course of the evening, many topics were covered, but one stuck in my mind... We were trying to come up with examples of good elearning. It's not easy! Especially when "good" means "effective" - ie. they actually help people to learn, to make a lasting change. (See the [Elearning Network's Campaign for Effective Elearning](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/content/campaign-effective-elearning)) Anyhow, on reflection, I've come up with three characteristics that might help us to identify effective elearning. (But use them alongside Stephen Downes excellent article on [Principles of Effective Elearning](http://www.downes.ca/post/13))
