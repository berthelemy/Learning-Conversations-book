> "All sorts of ideas, if left to themselves, are gradually forgotten." [Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology, Chapter VII](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/memory7.htm), Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885)

If you need to be convinced of that, read up on the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), which shows "that humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material." Ebbinghaus's theory, which seems to fit practice very well, is that the speed of forgetting depends on two main factors:

1.  how the memory is represented in the brain
2.  repetition

If the idea is easy to remember - ie. it can be represented through a number of senses (an image, a smell, a sound) and connects into existing memories then repetition is less important. If the idea is more abstract and less connected to other memories (eg. a phone number) then repetition is essential. "The capacity of memory is initially less than 30 seconds. If we don't repeat the information it disappears." [John Medina - Brain Rules: Short Term memory](http://www.brainrules.net/short-term-memory) Just because someone can answer a quiz at the end of your elearning package doesn't mean that they will remember it tomorrow, or even in an hour's time. Good elearning design incorporates elements that will help users to remember what they're learning, like repetition, connections to previous ideas, and connections to other senses. But good learning _solution_ design makes sure that repetition is built in across the whole solution, not just a package that may be used for 20 minutes, but also in the pre and post communications, and in any face-to-face or virtual events.
