## Thought-provoking {#thought-provoking}

It's all very well having fun while using elearning materials. But what you're trying to do is get people to change the way they behave or think. For that to occur, good elearning will cause people to reflect on what they currently do/think and start working the way the elearning is suggesting. You actually want to bring in some element of "[cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)" - putting people in a state where they may end up trying to hold two conflicting ideas. Often, this brings out some emotion. But, even if people disagree with what the content is saying, at least you've stimulated a reaction. That's better than no reaction at all. You're wanting people to question what is happening, then to question their own behaviours and thinking, and then to change. In marketing terms, it's the point of "conversion" - The point at which a recipient of a marketing message performs a desired action ([MarketingSherpa blog: Conversion defined](http://sherpablog.marketingsherpa.com/marketing/conversion-defined/)).
