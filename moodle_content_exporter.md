"The Content Exporter is a general framework for writing Moodle course content to a variety of formats. Unlike the general (and wonderfully thorough) Moodle backup component, the Content Exporter focuses on creating human readable exports which are convenient for distribution." If you've got lots of Moodle resources in a course and want to provide a way of reading them offline then this exporter does the job.
