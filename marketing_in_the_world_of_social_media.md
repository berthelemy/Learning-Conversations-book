The [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/) is the place to go if you're serious about joining in the conversation about your products. But, here are some ideas to help get you started:

1.  The marketplace is a two-way conversation. You're not talking **to** your market and telling them what you're good at, you're talking **with** your market about shared problems.
2.  Conversations on the web rely on authenticity and honesty. If you're going to talk "marketing-speak" then you will be found out and (at best) ignored very quickly.
3.  You cannot just tell people that you're good at whatever it is you sell, you need to demonstrate expertise. Basically you do that by giving away knowledge. It's what's expected. If I go to a website that's just full of [brochureware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware), I tend to lose confidence in that company.
4.  To demonstrate expertise you need to either get involved in open conversations about your specialist areas, or you need to give away easily digestible chunks of knowledge on a regular basis. Ideally you'll be doing both.
5.  The companies that do inspire confidence are the ones that are responsive (ie. picking up on issues quickly and keeping the market informed) and the ones that are honest (if something doesn't work yet, then say so!)
6.  Finally, and most importantly, make sure the product you're selling is worth talking about!
