A very helpful document that covers:

> Three critical success factors From observations of many different records management system rollouts through organisations (most of which haven't been successful), we have identified three areas that must be addressed: * Software The design and usability of the records management software, with a particular focus on ease of use for general business users. * Classification scheme Ensuring the classification scheme is designed to ensure general business users store records in the correct location, and to help them find records again at a later date. * Message The 'message' that drives the internal communications and change management efforts, beyond simply 'you must use the software'.
