# If you're asking "Why?" {#if-you-re-asking-why}

_Date posted: 18 November 2011_

There are times when I wonder about the whole purpose and rationale of the work I do. Where does it fit into the grand scheme of things? What real benefit am I bringing to humanity? Big questions. Often, they're very hard to answer. Especially when you're a small cog in a big, corporate machine. Yesterday, however, I came across something that indicated that at least some of what I do can have wider meaning than just helping people use technology better... When you can use that technology to create something beautiful. When it's not about the technology, but about bringing together people from across the world with one creative purpose. I wasn't part of this particular project, but it shows amazingly what is possible. I'm hoping as you watch this you will see the potential that technology offers to enable participation in creating solutions. Even if you don't, just enjoy the experience!
