# Learning Conversations

This book is a curated selection of posts made during the 12 years of working out loud on my Learning Conversations blog.

In working through the many hundreds of posts, I have come across some that show just how naive I was at the time, some that reminded me of how much things have changed, and many that got me thinking again.

It's this last set that I've republished here.

They cover a wide range of topics - reflecting my professional and personal interests over the years. Early on, the focus was on education, schools and teacher professional development. That morphed into social networks and learning design. And the latter stages tend to be about organisational change, IT and project management.

In places, I have supplemented the original post with additional comments to show where my thinking is now, but, mostly, the posts remain unedited - except where links or media no longer exist.
