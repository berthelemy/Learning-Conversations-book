# Learning Conversations

Early experiences with Skype, Google Maps & RSS Readers

Resources, tools and learning materials that have gone the way of the dodo.

I am the Managing Director of a learning and technology consultancy ([Wyver Solutions Ltd](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/)) (based in Belper, Derbyshire, UK). Specialising in:

*   Learning technologies such as content management systems, learning management systems, content authoring tools, collaboration tools
*   Helping senior management understand the potential of such tools
*   Understanding the human factors involved in the successful implementation of new IT systems
*   Providing configuration services, training and support
*   Acting as the interface between IT, Management and the Learning & Development team

I am passionate about putting the learner, the user at the centre of what we do. This blog is where I put personal thoughts and ideas - often about, but not exclusively, learning technology.
