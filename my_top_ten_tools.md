# My top ten tools {#my-top-ten-tools}

_Date posted: 9 July 2007_

I thought I'd get in on the act, and suggest my top ten tools for [Jane Hart's collection](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/). She's already got [Jay Cross](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/jaycross.html) & [Clive Shepherd](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/cliveshepherd.html), so let's hope I can come up with something different... **[Firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/)** Number one spot has to go to Firefox. It's my window on the web. It's becoming the main place where I find information, create materials and ideas, and collaborate with other people. Since I also create a lot of web-based material it's my principal development assistant. The web-developer toolbar extension is essential to help troubleshoot tricky layouts. **[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)** If Firefox is my window on the web, Google Reader is a pair of binoculars. It's the first page I open every day. It allows me to easily keep track with current thinking, and to join in conversations. When used with sites like [Blogdigger](http://www.blogdigger.com/), I can discover new pockets of expertise very easily. **[b2evolution](http://www.b2evolution.net/)** I know Wordpress is a very good blogging platform, but I've worked with b2evolution for a few years now and have found it incredibly stable and capable - and very well supported. It's designed, from the ground up, to offer multiple blogs to multiple individuals and groups. If people are looking for a platform to support reflective CPD I always point them here. **[Etomite](http://www.etomite.org/)** Having a good, flexible content management system in your bag is an essential part of being a learning systems provider. They allow you to devolve content production, build navigation automatically, provide search capability, and reuse content in many ways across the site. For me, it was a toss-up between Etomite and [ExponentCMS](http://www.exponentcms.org/). Both are very good, and highly configurable. Where Etomite steals the show though is it's handling of friendly URLs and its ability to export the whole site to a static set of web-pages. Great for clients that want a large site generated quickly, but don't want to do any editing on it. **[Snagit](http://www.snagit.com/)** I don't buy much software; I tend to use what's available in the open-source world. However, when there's nothing out there for free, with the same capabilities, I will spend the money. Snagit is one of those tools. It's a screen capture tool on steroids. You can very quickly capture a window (or just a portion of a screen, or a pull-down menu), resize it, annote it, add edge effects like a drop shadow or a torn edge, and save or publish it. For producing quick users guides it's essential. **[Mindmanager](http://www.mindjet.com/)** Mindmanager is another one of those tools that is so well developed that I'm happy to spend money on it. Although [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/) comes a very close second as an open source alternative. They both allow you to create, edit and publish [Mind Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping). Where MindManager wins is its integration with other tools like Word, Outlook and MS Project. It also comes with a number of very usable HTML templates for publishing. You can, very quickly, produce a structured information resource with dozens of pages and a coherent navigation structure. **[PSPad](http://www.pspad.com/)** I do a lot of code editing (HTML, CSS, PHP mainly) and I always need a good editor that doesn't get in the way. PSPad is my current choice. It integrates with Windows Explorer nicely, highlights code well and allows me to keep whole projects together in one place. **[iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)** I don't like following the crowd. So I resisted iTunes as long as possible. Until I got a Mac. Until then I'd been using a podcast catcher that sat on my mp3 player. But I'm afraid Apple's design team won again. The whole way the software integrates with the iTunes webservice is just great. I'm still not an iPod user, so I had to get an additional (free) tool - [SyncTunes](http://www.nesfield.co.uk/synctunes/) to pull stuff out of iTunes onto the mp3 player. I rely on podcasts alongside Google Reader to engage with the learning community. It means driving time is not wasted. **[Google search](http://www.google.co.uk/)** At risk of being boring, I really don't know how I'd do my job without a decent search engine. It's both a research and a problem-solving tool. Nuff said. **[Kashflow](http://www.kashflow.co.uk/)** I spent a long time looking for a system to help manage the accounts for [Wyver Solutions](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/). I can learn software pretty easily usually, but every single system seemed to need an in-depth knowledge of accounting terms and practices. The crunch came when I moved to the Mac, and the tool I was using (as best of a bad bunch) would not work on it. I came across Kashflow and tried their two month free trial. It's a web-based system; with all the advantages that brings. They've got the financial backing of a former Secretary of State for Employment, Trade and Industry. I understand it. The support is great. And my accountant likes what comes out at the end. It's not free. But I wouldn't expect a high-quality, robust service to be so. So that's my top ten tools. I've missed out a lot of tools that I use on a daily basis. These are the ones I would be stuck without at the moment. Although I'm sure alternatives would come in their place.
