# Connectivism & K-12 {#connectivism-k-12}

_Date posted: 9 March 2005_

(This is a copy of a posting I made on the [Connectivism](http://www.connectivism.ca/) discussion forum.) I've just been listening to George Siemen's [presentation & discussion about Connectivism](http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/001956.html), and feel that he's selling it somewhat short in discounting its use in K-12 education (or primary & secondary as we call it in the UK). I agree, it's totally suited to lifelong learning in the workplace, but the only reason it doesn't fit K-12 at the moment is because the curriculum models adopted by most countries do not map well to the needs of the lifelong learner. Most curriculum models assume, as George did, that children are like buckets to be filled up with knowledge - and it's not until they've got a certain amount of knowledge that they become able to be self-evaluating learners, capable of dialogue. Most early years practitioners, would I believe, disagree violently with that understanding of young children. Children learn more rapidly than adults by making, breaking & changing connections. Not necessarily using technology as there are so many connections to be made locally without needing technology to support them. There is a significant move away from the "knowledge" curriculum model for schools, towards one that focusses on learning how to learn - which fits Connectivism like a glove. [Tasmania](http://www.education.tas.gov.au/ocll/publications/default.htm) has taken on that curriculum model wholesale, and both the [Royal Society of Arts](http://www.thersa.org/newcurriculum/) and the [Qualifications & Curriculum Authority](http://www.qca.org.uk/10969.html) in the UK are exploring it in detail. It also ties in with the work being done by [NESTA](http://www.nestafuturelab.org/research/reviews/ts19.htm). Novak's work on Concept Maps in K-12 maybe doesn't go quite as far as the Connectivism theory, but it does illustrate a different way of approaching education using Connectivist ideals, focussing on the self-evaluation of learning: [http://cmc.ihmc.us/papers/cmc2004-285.pdf](http://cmc.ihmc.us/papers/cmc2004-285.pdf)). He talks about learning as being actuated knowledge, making the point that it's much easier to actuate knowledge in the workplace than in an educational institution (of whatever type). Which comes back to the question, are our educational institutions in their current form a suitable environment for learning in the connected age? Which then leads to the higher question (as being addressed by the institutions above), what do we want people to gain from our educational institutions? Connectivism, combined with changes to the curriculum and changes in our expectations of learning institutions will, I'm sure be a powerful model for learning. And I, for one, would jump at the chance to implement it in a K-12 school.
