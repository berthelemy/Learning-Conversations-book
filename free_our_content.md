# Free Our Content {#free-our-content}

As [I wrote earlier today](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/08/16/if-i-was-in-charge?blog=5) and [also back in 2008](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/06/courses-and-content?blog=5), I believe that Learning Management Systems are **not** the place to be locking away content. To get the full return on investment, content should be placed somewhere that search engines (whether internal or external) can find and index it. (BTW. That probably means we need to rethink our dependence on Flash as a delivery mechanism for elearning content too...) ![Free Our Content logo](./exportlc.php_files/4899432110_0874ee6aa3.jpg) If you agree, then you might want to take a copy of this code and pop it on your blog, Facebook page etc.
