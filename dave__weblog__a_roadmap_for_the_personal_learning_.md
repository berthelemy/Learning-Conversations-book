Article looking a the future of ELGG, with my response (posted below) Hi Dave, Your ideas seem to match those of Graham Atwell (http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/weblog.entries/5204214444) and also my own (http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=5&title=i_have_a_dream&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1). I have a question though: do you have a vision where multiple ELGG installations will be able to communicate with each other? This would then bring us into the realm of distributed learning environments as envisaged by Stephen Downes - where I can put a search into my personal learning landscape and it would link me up with appropriate people & ideas from across a range of ELGG's. As you say, strong permissions will be key.
