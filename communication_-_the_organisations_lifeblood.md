# Communication - the organisation's lifeblood {#communication-the-organisation-s-lifeblood}

[Hans de Zwart, writing in his blog this week about Automattic](http://blog.hansdezwart.info/2012/03/11/welcome-to-the-chaos-the-distributed-workspace/%3Cbr%20/%3E) (the company behind Wordpress) states "They would say that their productivity as a company is dependent on how well they communicate." I have seen so many examples of organistations where the opposite is the reality: Where the communication structures in place actually inhibit productivity. If knowledge and information is the lifeblood of your organisation, shouldn't you provide every means possible to allow it to flow freely?
