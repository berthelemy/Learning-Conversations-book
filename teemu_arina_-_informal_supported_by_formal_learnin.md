Picked this up from [Jay Cross](http://informl.com/?p=722). Most organisations approach informal learning by looking at how it can support formal learning (courses etc). [Teemu Arina](http://tarina.blogging.fi/) has taken the opposite viewpoint and put informal learning at the centre. But... most organisations have a learning culture (if they have one at all) that is based on formal learning and on training records. Might putting informal learning at the centre be too much of a culture shift?? Or should we be proposing this as the end point, with stages in-between?
