# Credit for the term Learning Conversations {#credit-for-the-term-learning-conversations}

_Date posted: 27 July 2012_

Quite out of the blue this week, I received a comment on one of my posts, from [Prof Laurie Thomas](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/laurie-thomas/13/807/8aa) (if I've got the LinkedIn link to the wrong person, let me know!)

> I wonder whether you have identified the source of the scientific term "Learning Conversations" If not let me point you towards our books - "Learning Conversations:- The Self-Organised Learning Way to Personal and Organisational Growth" Published by ROUTLEDGE 1991 "Self-Organised Learning:- Foundations of a Conversational Science for Psychology" 1985 and "Learning to change" in the McGraw-Hill Training Series 1995 there are over 40 Ph.D theses in Brunel University Library which all contributed to the development of S-O-L and Learning Conversations. It seems a pity that you are unable to acknowledge this resource. Or if you do. We would welcome more explicit acknowledgement. Or find you own terminology, rather than debasing ours. Thank you!

I hadn't realised that Learning Conversations was a "scientific term", although it doesn't surprise me that someone's used it as a term to describe a process in an academic research context.

Given that I don't have access to academic libraries, it's not surprising that I failed to pick this up...

I hope this post provides the explicit acknowledgment Prof. Thomas is looking for.

I also hope that my use of the term Learning Conversation as a website name, and in my ongoing discussion of the use of conversations to support learning, does not debase too much the work Prof. Thomas and his colleagues have carried out.

If anyone has a copy of the books referenced above, I'd be interested to read them. They appear to be out of print.
