# Are you a learning solutions architect? {#are-you-a-learning-solutions-architect}

A Learning Solutions Architect works in a very similar way to a real-world buildings architect. They act as the central point for the design of a solution. They get to understand the client's needs and wants intimately. They know that their solution must fit into the existing infrastructure and surrounding landscape. They can explain complex ideas simply to the many interested parties - in their language. They have to be flexible and work within fixed budgets. So, how do you know if you're a learning solutions architect? Here are a few scenarios that I come across on a regular basis. Let me know if they ring bells with you. Do you ask your clients "Why?" more often than they might be comfortable with? Do you turn complex ideas into simple pictures? Do you act as an interpreter between IT and Learning & Development? Do you talk to IT about bandwidth, hosting, firewalls and browser compatibility? Do you talk to Learning & Development about the differences between behaviourist, cognitivist, constructivist and connectivist approaches to learning? Do you talk to the Programme team about where learning, and its associated systems, fit into the wider picture? Do you have a healthy appetite for learning about new tools, systems and ideas that might have a place in future designs?
