# What's in it for me? {#what-s-in-it-for-me}

What's in it for me? That sounds so selfish! But it's how we prioritise. We do it every day - all the time. Whether it's a conscious decision or not; we always decide to do things on the basis of whether we think it's going to good for us or good for something/someone that we are linked to. That's why it is **so** important that we ensure the learning experiences we design are absolutely explicit about what learners will get out of it, and what's expected of them. Learning designers (and I include teachers in this group) like to work with objectives. It's what we've been trained to do. They set the boundaries and the reasons for designing a particular learning experience. We assume that learners will like objectives just as much as we do. So we copy them onto the board at the beginning of lessons, or put them in our course catalogues. How much does that really set the learners' expectations? Does that give them enough so they know (really know) what's in it for them? I've [mentioned the Manager Tools team before](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/mark/2007/06/18/manager_tools_an_intriguing_business_mod). I was listening to their recent show about their forthcoming conference. I can't go - it's in Texas. But here's what I know about it already:

*   It's two days long
*   It's in September
*   Only 100 people will be able to attend
*   It will be an intensive two days
*   The last conference was a life-changing experience for many people (based on the comments on the forum)
*   The days will be very long (compared to the UK - where people expect to start around 10am and finish about 3:30pm)
*   There will be lots of opportunity to get all my questions answered by an expert in management
*   I know he's an expert from listening to the other shows, and seeing the answers to questions on the forum
*   The sessions will take the ideas already discussed on other shows, and help me to apply them in practice
*   I will be expected to practice the skills discussed
*   There will be lots of practice
*   There will be coaches sitting in on the practice sessions to help me develop
*   There will be breaks every hour
*   I will make lots of contacts
*   I will be able to follow up on the forum afterwards

So, at this point, I already know far more about this event and what I'll get out of it than any other formal learning experience I've had. I've not just got a list of objectives and speaker biographies. I know exactly what it's going to be like. I can make a proper decision whether to invest my time/money/effort in attending. If it was in the UK, I could certainly argue the business case for it now. [More details about the conference.](http://www.manager-tools.com/effective-management-conference/)
