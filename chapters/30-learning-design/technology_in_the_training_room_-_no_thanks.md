# Technology in the training room - no thanks! {#technology-in-the-training-room-no-thanks}

_Date posted: 9 June 2011_

There's a lot of talk in L&D teams these days about using mobile technology (usually tablets) in the training room. It's similar to the discussions schools had (or in most cases didn't have!) when the last government's Interactive WhiteBoard funding came in. In many cases, the talk is focussed on the glitz that technology brings. "It'll make us look modern... up-to-date." There's often very little discussion about the real place for technology in learning. The classroom is probably the worst place to put technology. You're wasting the valuable time where you've got a group of people in the same room. That time should be spent conversing, listening and discussing, not interacting with screens or with people outside of the room. Yes, there will be times when the facilitator (or one of the delegates) wants to demonstrate something, or show a video to help with a particular point. But that should be the exception. In general, I would argue that the ideal position is that all technology (apart from pens and paper) is left outside the classroom. And that includes Powerpoint! It means you focus on the people and the conversation in the room, rather than on what's happening outside. What this means is that, when there's content to be digested, reflections to be written up, or conversations to happen with people outside of the classroom, this should happen outside of the time allocated for the classroom. For example, let's take a workshop that's designed to "train" people how to do performance appraisals...

### Before the workshop: {#before-the-workshop}

Produce materials (audio, video, written, whatever) that will get people thinking about the process, and about the issues they'll need to address. Make it totally clear that the workshop will not be re-presenting those things.

### During the workshop: {#during-the-workshop}

Highlight the key issues, get people talking about the questions raised, and practice the bits that need practicing (eg. how to give feedback). Use a printed mind map or concept map if you need something to hang the discussion on.

### After the workshop: {#after-the-workshop}

Encourage delegates to reflect in a public space on what they've learnt. You could even make this a condition of getting an attendance certificate! Using this approach will make far better use of the time available, and be far more effective in terms of what delegates are able to do afterwards. It also means that your classroom sessions will become seen as a much more valuable part of what you're offering. Of course, this is an ideal situation, that depends on a whole host of cultural and organisational factors. In reality, there's probably still a place for technology in the classroom, for the moment anyway...
