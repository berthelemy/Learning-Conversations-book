L&D Departments need a toolkit that can support a wider range of learning activities than most L&D departments are currently concerned with. Some of these tools may not be owned by L&D, but by internal comms, or even IT. But L&D will need to be aware of them, and have access to them. It might be possible to work on a small-pieces, loosely-joined approach, like that advocated by [David Weinberger](http://www.smallpieces.com/). That's a great approach for maximum flexibility and speed to change. But it doesn't make the best use of the masses of data that will accumulate in these systems, unless, like the consumer-focussed platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Ebay etc) you provide well-documented [APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to allow communication between the tools. That data could then be mined to enable organisations to target support more effectively (the Facebook approach). If you knew what people were searching about and discussing, you could understand what the training needs were in your organisation. It could also be exposed to users to enable them to make more informed choices (the Amazon approach). By collecting data about collective behaviour, you can make recommendations to individuals. To achieve this, perhaps [IMS Global](http://www.imsglobal.org/) needs to start looking at wider scenarios than just formal training/learning, and begin to develop a set of simple APIs that vendors can sign up to for data transmission via web-services? That's a big ask. I know how long it takes to get agreement on anything like this... Of course, an alternative would be for the major players in the LMS and social learning market to get together and agree (**and publish!**) APIs that anyone can then adopt. That feels more feasible... See also: [The changing face of learning & development](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2011/02/23/the-changing-face-of-learning?blog=5)
