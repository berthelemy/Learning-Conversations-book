# Features & Benefits of online learning {#features-benefits-of-online-learning}

_Note: I'm only looking here at one specific context - adult professional development within an organisation. These are high-level messages aimed at senior management._ As with any learning strategy, the solution adopted should match the problem being solved. Different problems may require different solutions. The online environment is an addition to the learning professional's toolkit, which may already include elements such as face-to-face training, books, coaching sessions, mentoring programmes etc. Introducing online learning provides the following benefits:

*   It enables easier version control of materials, since there is always only one, central copy of materials to be used;
*   It enables workshop facilitators to focus on embedding, reinforcing and practising ideas, rather than 'delivering' content;
*   It gives learners control over what, how and when they learn;
*   It provides management tools that may help evaluation of learning materials and activities.

To achieve these benefits using the online environment is as much of an art as in getting the best out of the face-to-face environment. However there are some general guidelines that we have found work well in professional development contexts:

*   Ensure that you don't lose the benefits to the learner by removing control from them - in terms of what, how and when they learn. Minimise the barriers to participation or your online learning initiative will fail.
*   Learning is not about delivering content - it is about people engaging with that content and doing something with it, such as discussing it, practising the ideas, taking a test, re-presenting the ideas etc. Some of this can be done online; some is best done face-to-face.
*   Ensure your learners' expectations are set appropriately from the start - with clear marketing and joining instructions;
*   Use the management tools carefully - the things that are easy to measure often provide meaningless information (eg. data that tells you that someone has viewed a particular page in their browser does not tell you they've learnt anything).

I know there's a lot of detail missed out here. But what other high-level messages would you want to give to an organisation considering online learning?
