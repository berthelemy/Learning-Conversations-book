## Update to top 10 tools {#update-to-top-10-tools}

_Date posted: 9 January 2008_

I've just updated [my list of Top Ten Tools](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/markberthelemy.html) for [Jane Hart's Centre for Learning & Performance Technologies](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/index.html). It was an interesting exercise, just to see how my work has changed over the past 6 months. The list is now focussed on "learning" tools, rather than any tool that I use for work - so [Kashflow](http://www.kashflow.co.uk/) is out. The CMS has changed, and so has the screen capture tool. Not because there's anything wrong with the others, but because Joomla & Jing are a better fit for what I currently do. I've also moved away from MindManager for the moment, to using CmapTools more. Mainly because I find it fits my thought processes better. So, here's the full current list:

1.  [Firefox](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/firefox.html). (Open source).  This remains at the top spot. In fact, it's such a central part of my daily learning (both consuming and creating) that I almost put it at the same level as my broadband connection - essential. What's special about it over other browsers? It was the first tabbed browser I used, which completely changed the way I use the web. It's got hundreds of add-ons, including the indispensible web-developer toolbar, Colorzilla (for easily matching colours), Scrapbook (for quickly taking snapshots of webpages for annotating later) and QuickProxy (which, with one click, lets you switch your proxy server on & off).
2.  [Jing](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/jing.html). (Closed source, but free).I'm finding I'm using this more and more. It's similar to Wink, Captivate and Snagit. However, where these are great for producing finished, polished products, Jing just sits there for when it's needed and works quickly. It's ideal for producing "disposable learning objects" (not my term, but it's starting to appear more frequently). If I need to show someone how a software function works, I capture it (either as a single image or a movie - with narration, then can choose whether to publish it to TechSmith's Screencast.com site, to my own ftp site, or to a file. It's simple. It's easy to use. And my clients think it's great.
3.  [Google Web Search](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/google.html). (Free to use). I know other search engines are available. But I can work Google. I know how to make it produce meaningful results. 95% of the time it does what I need. So why change? Without search, the wealth of information on the web would be like a library with no index: impossible to use effectively. With it, I know that I can learn almost anything **when I need to**.
4.  [Google Desktop Search](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googledesktop.html). (Closed source, but free).  Just as I rely on Google web search almost more than my bookmarks, I rely on their desktop search engine to be able to find files and emails rather than wade through layers of folders. It's not infallible - being particularly frustrating when it displays part of an email, but then Outlook can't open it because it's been moved. But this is more than mitigated by the number of times its found a document that I couldn't see anywhere in my file structure.
5.  [Moodle](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/moodle.html). (Open source).I've been working with Moodle for four years - since version 1 came out. Although designed to work within a formal education setting, its beauty is in its flexibility. Every organisation, and every person, will use Moodle in a different way. It's would be a particularly mature learning organisation which uses every function of Moodle. Now that we've cracked the way the Moodle theme packs work, we're finding more and more applications for it - particularly in public sector organisations. There are two things that Moodle does not do well. One is handling bookings for face-to-face events, so some sort of Learner records system is an essential component of a complete solution. The other is handling content for use outside of a formal "course"-based delivery. See 6.
6.  [Joomla](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/joomla.html). (Open source).   Any organisation that wishes to support learners at their point of need, as well as during formal "courses" needs an effective content management system. It needs to be searchable. It needs to allow administrators (and even users) to add content easily. And it needs to be flexible in terms of appearance and navigation. There are many content management systems out there. The commercial ones are tending to aim at high-end usage; with multi-format publishing, workflows, faceted search etc. For many applications, the range of open source solutions is more than adequate. Each one has its particular strengths; some have highly comprehensive configuration interfaces, some are better for bespoking, some provide immediately usable out-of-the-box solutions. But I had to choose one for this list. Joomla appears to have a strong development team. The modules available, both in the standard package, and as add-ons, are incredibly powerful. It does require careful configuration, and good support, as a complex site can become complex to change. At the moment, though, this is tending to be top of my list for content management.
7.  [Articulate Engage](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/articulate.html). (Commercial).   Along with its big brother, Articulate Presenter, Engage is rapidly becoming a key part of my content development strategy. With Engage, I can quickly produce good-looking Flash-based materials with embedded media navigated using one of a set of pre-defined interfaces. These interfaces include (among others) a timeline, concentric rings, image hotspots, pyramids with layers and FAQs. Yes, you are limited to the interfaces available. But they pretty much cover most situations. I use Engage when I need to deliver something that looks good and covers a small amount of content. As a component part of a content strategy it's ideal.
8.  [Google Reader](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googlereader.html). (Free to use). Keeping up-to-date is a rapidly changing field, and knowing what the market is saying about learning, about technology, and about us is critical for success. An RSS reader allows me to do that without having to go to dozens of websites to see if they've got anything new. Google Reader has been my reader of choice for a year now. I can use it from any internet-connected browser. I can organise things just how I want. I can even share particular items, or whole groups of items, with other people in many different ways. I like the way it allows me to choose how I use it - its flexibility.
9.  [b2evolution](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/b2evolution.html). (Open source). I use my blog to reflect on what I'm learning, to add to the conversation about particular topics, and to store ideas and materials that I want to remember. It's an essential part of my personal knowledge management system. I chose to host it on my own webspace as then I control the data within it. It's too important to be left to a free service. And I don't need to pay someone to host it. I chose b2evolution for its flexibility. It's a multi-user, multi-blog system. Very similar to WordpressMU but far easier to install and configure.
10.  [CmapTools](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/cmap.html). (Free to certain groups). When I've got some complex ideas to sort out and simplify, I quite often turn to CmapTools. This is a concept mapping tool that allows any concept to link to any other concept, along with linking phrases. Very quickly, a map can become too complex. But then that forces a thought process to simplify it down to its essentials. I often go through that process when preparing presentations or learning materials. It makes sure you only include detail that is relevant

## The free tool selection grid {#the-free-tool-selection-grid}

_Date posted: 19 November 2008_

[Jane Hart](http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/) has made a fantastic contribution to the learning professional's community with her ongoing [top 100 tools](http://c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/top100.html) list. During this week's [Learning Trends conference](http://www.learntrends.com/) she takes that list and pulls out the "25 Free Tools Every Learning Professional Should Have in their Toolbox". The discussion that followed included the question: Is anyone worried about free tools that could go away? A while back, I wrote a piece for Seb Scholler's blog about [Free Stuff in a Commercial World](http://fm.schmoller.net/2006/05/free_stuff_in_a.html), which discussed the need to understand the business model that was behind the free tools. It's important to note that free tools fit into two broad camps:

*   Closed source, but free to use - eg. [Jing](http://www.jingproject.com/)
*   Open source - eg. [Moodle](http://moodle.org/) et al

Tools that fit into either of those two groups can also be in two other groups:

*   Solid business model or an active development community
*   No obvious source of funding or active support

In the spirit of consultants all over the world, I've put together two grids that may help other learning professionals decide whether a particular free tool is right for them. The first takes the ideas above and populates it with free tools (please note these are my current opinions only - I'm prepared to have them changed!)

|  | **Closed source** | **Open source** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solid business model or an active development community** | Google docs, Zoho, Jing | Moodle, b2evolution, Joomla |
| **No obvious source of funding or active support** | Frappr, Delicious | Nvu |

Where would your favourite tools sit? Of course, there's also longevity and reputation to consider - the longer a tool has been around the more likely it is to stay around. And the more people that think highly of the tool, the more likely it is to stay. The second grid looks at the purpose for which you are considering the tool:

|  | **Solid business model or an active development community** | **No obvious source of funding or active support** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Short term tactical goals** | Would easily transfer to long term if required | Ideal for experimentation |
| **Long term strategic goals** | Probably a sensible choice | Living dangerously |

Basically, you need to consider how important the tool is to you. If it's going to take a long term investment in terms of time and data then you need to be pretty sure it's going to be around for a while. Of course, this is exactly the analysis you'd need to do for any paid-for tool. It's not rocket science, just a matter of undertaking a process due diligence before you make your long term choices.

## Top 10 Tools {#top-10-tools}

_Date posted: 5 November 2009_

The following is an update to my top 10 tools, as listed at: http://c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/markberthelemy.html Caveat: My role changes rapidly depending very much on the project(s) I'm working on. This set of tools reflects the one I'm using most at the moment.

1.  Still [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox), but [Chrome](http://www.google.co.uk/chrome) is a close second. My browser, as well as being a research tool is where I run applications, and troubleshoot designs. It needs to be standards compliant (ie. not IE) and have tools within it that help with the design process. Which leads on to my second tool...
2.  The [Firefox Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60), is an addon to Firefox that is indispensible for sorting out problems with HTML and CSS. Especially important with complex applications like Moodle which has multiple, nested CSS files.
3.  [b2evolution](http://b2evolution.net/), still the engine that I use to power my [Learning Conversations](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/) blog. It's immensely powerful, especially so if you want multi-user and multi-blog systems - far easier to set up than [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/). However, for what I and most people need, actually my next tool is probably more suited.
4.  Wordpress has a superb user interface. It's very easy to skin and is flexible enough to be the underlying application for most content-based websites. The menuing system, in particular, is a joy to use (compared to [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/), which is extremely powerful but complex for the end user - the site administrator).
5.  [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) - still my collection point for RSS feeds. I haven't found anything better, and I'll certainly never go back to a client-based system. The browser wins again!
6.  [Googlemail](http://www.googlemail.com/). I've moved away from Apple Mail, as I could never get hold of my emails when I was on the move. Googlemail lets me collect all my email accounts in one place. Search is great, and so is the filtering and filing system. It's only let down by its inability to sort by anything.
7.  [Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). I've only got into this issue tracking and project tool recently. It's used by the Moodle development team, and we're also using on other projects. It's excellent for managing distributed teams, whilst keeping all the project information in one place.
8.  [Balsamiq mockups](http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups). If you need to discuss with your client how a site or application will be laid out on the screen, and how the navigation will work, you don't want to be wasting time on colour schemes. Balsamiq mockups gives you a way of creating mockups that look hand-drawn. Allowing you to focus on the important stuff.
9.  [Moodle](http://moodle.org/). I can't get away from it. Moodle is just well featured and designed around the needs of the teacher. Yes, it's a little clunky in places - but I'll tell you, I've seen far worse! The thing I really like about it is the way it's so easy to integrate with other systems.
10.  [Visio](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/default.aspx). My toolkit will always include some means of providing visual representations of complex ideas. That could be [Powerpoint](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx), [Mind Manager](http://www.mindjet.com/), [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), [CmapTools](http://cmap.ihmc.us/), [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) etc. Each tool is best for a slightly different context and purpose. The one I'm finding myself drawn to more often at the moment (because I'm having to think a lot about processes) is Visio. It's way more powerful than I'm ever going to need, but I haven't got anything better to use as a quick way of producing diagrams and flow charts.

## Top 10 tools for learning 2010 {#top-10-tools-for-learning-2010}

_Date posted: 28 June 2010_

Jane Hart is collating her annual list of the tools people use to support learning and development.

Here's my contribution. In descending order of importance:

1.  [Google search](http://www.google.com/). Need I say more? It's fast. I know how to get the best out of it. It's my secondary brain.
2.  [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome). I was a Firefox person, but Chrome is just so much faster. My browser is my gateway to information and to people. It's also where I test any web-based materials I create . Chrome's developer analysis tools are second-to-none.
3.  [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp). From Techsmith. Allows you to quickly take screenshots, or just particular windows or parts of the screen, and then to make them look pretty (eg. torn edges, shadows, arrows) quickly and easily. You can even save profiles, so that every screenshot automatically gets the same treatment.
4.  [Jing](http://www.jingproject.com/). Also from Techsmith. But free. It creates 5 minute (max) videos of your screen activity along with any narration you want to do. There's no editing capability, but for ease of use and effectiveness it can't be beaten. I can't count the number of times I've been able to help people with a quick video that only took 5 mins to produce. Just as if I was showing them in person.
5.  [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/). It's not just a blogging tool. It's great as a content management system. Very flexible, and easy to customise. And with a fantastic [mobile (especially iPhone) interface](http://www.wptouch.com/)
6.  [Webex](http://www.webex.com/). There are other web-based meeting/presentation tools. But Webex is what we have available. It works. It's robust.
7.  [Moodle](http://moodle.org/). Flexible. Tried and tested. Teacher/trainer-friendly. And, with Moodle 2.0 coming out, even easier to connect to other Moodle's, repositories and data systems. Hard to beat really.
8.  [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader). The heart of my personal learning network. It's where I go for in-depth thought and analysis from people I trust to deliver.
9.  [Context Sensitive Learning](http://www.trainer1.com/Rapid_Application_Support.html). A tool that I push at every opportunity. It acts as middleware between systems that you're trying to get people to use, and the learning content that will help them use it.
10.  [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com/) or [Socialcast](http://www.socialcast.com/). Both very similar, and both work fantastically in large organisations to help break down the [structural holes](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/SHGI.pdf) (pdf) that stop ideas spreading.

## Top 10 tools for learning 2012 {#top-10-tools-for-learning-2012}

_Date posted: 20 September 2012_

Jane Hart ( @C4LPT ) is compiling the 6th annual list of Top 100 tools for learning. Here's my current set (based on what I'm using at the moment):

1.  [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com/) - one of the best mobile apps I've seen for consuming and filtering content.
2.  [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html) - a free tool, from the makers of Camtasia, for creating quick annotated images or 5 minute screen capture movies
3.  [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - I'm starting to use this as my sole note-taking and thinking tool. The way it synchronizes across all my devices is almost magical!
4.  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) - I haven't found a browser yet that matches it for simplicity and speed - essential for a knowledge worker
5.  [b2evolution](http://b2evolution.net/) - one of the most powerful multi-user, multi-blog platforms out there. I don't use even 50% of that power, but it's been the basis of my blog for many years. Its spam control measures are great.
6.  [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) - the website/blogging platform of choice for new projects. It's just so simple to use and to tweak. Spam control is a bit rubbish though!
7.  [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) - after considerable research, this is still the best corporate social platform available. Great multi-platform capabilities, and they really understand what drives conversation.
8.  [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader) - even though the interface has now lost quite a bit of "social' functionality, it's still the place where I maintain the list of RSS feeds from people and organisations that keep me up-to-date. It's where I go for deep-thinking. The link with Flipboard is excellent.
9.  [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) - Perfect for quick breaks to have a conversation with people who are around at the same time. Anything more extended than a couple of lines doesn't work on Twitter (IMO), but nice to feel you're part of a wider community. The link with Flipboard brings Twitter posts to life.
10.  [Yed Graph Editor](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html) - I'm still playing with this, but it's becoming an extremely useful tool to me; for organising thoughts and ideas.

[Edit: See also the [Wyver Solutions](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/) [Top 10 Tools for Learning from a corporate perspective](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/2012/09/20/top-10-tools-for-learning-corporate-perspective/)]
