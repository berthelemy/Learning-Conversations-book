# Is your home network safe? {#is-your-home-network-safe}

_Date posted: 6 October 2011_

Many of us work from home and use the internet on a daily basis. Just as in a city, the internet has some places that are good to be, and others that are not so good. The difference though is that, on the internet, you can be sent to one of those dodgy places from a single click. To protect you, your family and your work colleagues, I would advise a simple strategy that works just like a castle, with multi-layers of defence.[![Beaumaris Castle](./assets/300px-Beaumaris_Castle.jpg)](./assets/300px-Beaumaris_Castle.jpg) Beaumaris Castle - from [Wikipedia/Beaumaris Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumaris_Castle)

### Layer 1: Incoming traffic {#layer-1-incoming-traffic}

Usually, all the internet traffic that comes into your house will be coming through a single connection into your router. The router maintains the link to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Most ISP's operate as a transparent gateway onto the internet. So, what you need to do, is redirect your internet traffic so that it comes through a more secure route that you can control. The simplest way to do this is to use a service like [www.opendns.com](http://www.opendns.com/). With a single change to your router setup, all internet traffic will go through the OpenDNS servers which maintain lists of any sites that are dodgy. You can even extend this filtering to block other types of unwanted sites. OpenDNS is free to home users, so there's really no excuse not to make the change. Having said that, some of the basic routers that come from ISP's (eg. O2) don't make it particularly easy to change their setup. You may need to do a bit of digging on the OpenDNS forums, but you can be sure that someone will have done it already. Once your traffic is routed via OpenDNS, then anyone using your network, whether cabled or through WiFi, will be subject to whatever filtering you've switched on, and will be protected from vast numbers of sites that are just looking to damage your equipment or your bank account.

### Layer 2: Inbound email {#layer-2-inbound-email}

Make sure your email provider has methods of blocking spam (junk mail) and mail containing viruses. It makes life so much easier if they can do it for you. I use Google's gmail system, which is extremely efficient at both jobs, and rarely filters out messages wrongly.

### Layer 3: Your PC {#layer-3-your-pc}

If you're working on company-supplied computers, you often won't have any control over what systems are running on it. But it's still worth being aware of how to minimise the risks, when you use your own equipment. Most modern computer systems, whether with Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, are at risk in some way from attacks and viruses. Your router will provide some protection, but the next stage is with the operating system itself. The actual risk varies depending on the operating system you're using. Windows is under most attack, but that doesn't mean Mac & Linux users are free from risk - it's just lower. For maximum protection, it's worth spending money on one or two additional pieces of software - a firewall and an anti-virus system. Sometimes they come combined in the one application. There are also free tools, which are very good but perhaps without the support or service you'd get from a paid-for version. A firewall does what it says; it stops traffic getting into your computer that might cause damage. Usually you're given the option to let certain things through if you know what they are. I still find it surprising to see how many potential attacks are thwarted by firewalls. It's because attackers are constantly using automated tools to find and exploit weaknesses. An anti-virus tool prevents you downloading or opening files that might contain potentially malicious code. Usually they'll also try to "clean up" any infected files.

### Layer 4: Your browser {#layer-4-your-browser}

Your browser is your window on the internet, and, as such, is the last layer of defence against sites that are out to cause problems. Many of the major browsers will warn you if you end up on a web site that is known to contain malicious code. But this is only true if you keep your browser up-to-date. If you're still running Internet Explorer 6 or older (which, even now, is still quite likely if you're using a machine supplied by your employer) then you are running a very large risk every time you use the internet. It's no wonder that these organisations often make Layer 1 so secure/impenetrable as to make it almost impossible to use the internet usefully. Often, the older browsers are kept for good reasons - as the organisation's software may only run on that particular browser version. My advice would be (if you are allowed) to use Google Chrome or Firefox as your main browser for internet use, and keep IE just for using corporate systems.
