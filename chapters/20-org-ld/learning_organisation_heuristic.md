# Learning Organisation Heuristic {#learning-organisation-heuristic}

_Date posted: 2 November 2008_

Much as [I dislike questionnaires without a research-backing](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/09/25/personal-analysis-questionnaires?blog=5), sometimes they can be useful - just to get you started thinking. My work takes me into lots of different organisations, and my research & reading has led me to look at a number of different theories of management - particularly the management of learning. The following set of questions have no value judgements attached. They are simply to help you describe the current state of your organisation. You could use it in many ways, perhaps with senior managers, or even with a large group to provide evidence for management. But having the description is not enough. You then need to ask those managers "Why is this the case?" for each question. Look out for inconsistencies between the ideal and reality. Again, find out why.

> Keep asking "Why is this the case?" or "Why not?" until you get to the root of the issue. "Five Whys" is a common technique used to analyse issues...
