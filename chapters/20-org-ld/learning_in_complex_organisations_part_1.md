# Learning in Complex Organisations part 1 {#learning-in-complex-organisations-part-1}

I'm starting to sort out my thinking about learning in complex organisations, with a view to it becoming a subject for my Masters dissertation. As I put a few coherent thoughts together I'll post them here... At a recent workshop, we talked about "The Wisdom of Crowds", which describes the concept that "large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliantï¿½better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future." [http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/](http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/) Rather than thinking about professional development as something that comes out from a central learning organisation, the Wisdom of Crowds concept would treat the learning organisation as just one part of a network of people, organisations and resources (materials). In a well-connected network, each node (ie. a person, an organisation, or a resource), is initially no more important or indispensible than any other node. Any node can link to any other node. There is no hierarchy. However, nodes become more important as other nodes make links to them. They become hubs and thus key players in changing the way the network thinks. If a hub picks up an idea from one of its linked nodes, the idea will quickly disseminate through the rest of the network. To become a hub, you need to be seen to be offering something useful... perhaps that's where the consultants fit in... sifting ideas, sharing the best, developing new ideas. It is almost inevitable that the learning organisation will become a major hub since it will produce so much material. What then becomes important is how the other hubs make use of that material. But, for a network to operate well it needs to be open. If groups of nodes are kept separate from the rest, then the network is broken, and you lose the wisdom of crowds effect. That may have implications for the learning organisation, since an open network implies that a learner in Cornwall may "link" to an expert in Northumberland. Notice that I've not mentioned technology at all here. Networks can be built up without using technology, but they build quicker when you do use it (eg. with blogs, podcasts, RSS etc).
