# Social media and large risk averse organisations {#social-media-and-large-risk-averse-organisations}

There's a lot I could say on this topic, but much of that will have to wait for a while. I just wanted to highlight this report that's just been released, from Deloitte (one of the world's largest international accounting and consulting companies. It looks at how social media is used internally to drive innovation, and externally to drive customer engagement and recruitment. The key section for me is on how they managed the risk:

> To participate in social media you must unleash energy not try to control it. The process, technology and policy are easy. Getting the right attitude is hard. Deloitte Australia is developing a framework around how to manage social media risk, defining what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, monitoring use and, where appropriate, dealing with it. "In fact, knowing how to respond to an incident, and having a team ready to respond, will be a key." Tommy Viljoen, Risk Services partner and member of the Deloitte Social Media Steering Committee explained.
