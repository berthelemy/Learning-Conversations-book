# An hour of elearning? {#an-hour-of-elearning}

_Date posted: 7 June 2010_

Often, when I'm asked to cost up elearning design and development, the concept of an "hour of instruction" comes up. It's a term I've never been comfortable with. You'd never ask a writer to create an hour's worth of reading. You'd give them a word limit instead. Time measurements are only suitable for passive media, like radio or television, or (in our world) screencasts, podcasts and presentations. When you're asking people to actively engage with your medium, or to dip in and out, then time becomes irrelevant. What could we use instead? It's a tricky one, because good elearning is actually a combination of many different media elements:

*   Video, audio, animations - measured in minutes and seconds
*   Text - measured in words
*   Graphics and images - measured by the number required
*   Interactions, simulations, games and menus - measured by the number of touch points or branching points
*   Moderation & support, such as forums, social networks, email - measured by the number of staff and the time they're expected to be monitoring & contributing to

Don't ever hire an elearning designer who wants to get paid by the word count - the end result will be awful. Perhaps we ought to consider an inverse relationship: the price increases as the word count goes down?
