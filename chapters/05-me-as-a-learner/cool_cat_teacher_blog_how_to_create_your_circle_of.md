I was talking with some of my fellow learners on the Hull MEd course today. It was one of the rare occasions when we actually meet up face-to-face - it's not built into the course but there were enough people in the vicinity of Sheffield to make it worthwhile. Anyway, I was trying to explain the benefits of being plugged-in to the worldwide network of edubloggers, as opposed to restricting communications within the university's VLE. One the reasons I gave was that I learn just by listening-in to the conversations that are going on amongst people in the edublogosphere. It's not usually written in the academic language that University people seem to like - but it's the closest I'm coming to real-life action research - with people writing about what they've tried and how it went. I love this quote from CS Lewis, from Vicki's Cool Cat Teacher blog:

> "The next best thing to be wise oneself is to live in a circle of those who are." CS Lewis

The main objection from people in the group seemed to be the amount of time that it takes to remain plugged-in to the network. Vicki has summarised in a brilliant way [how to create your own circle of the wise](http://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/2006/12/how-to-create-your-circle-of-wise-how.html). I would encourage anyone starting out to read this post. For me, my circle of the wise started out with [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/) (who came well recommended from [Debra Marsh](http://www.hull.ac.uk/ces/courses/DebraMarsh.html)). From there, the circle of the wise has extended to many people who are my key thinkers in the fields of learning technology, elearning & knowledge management. Almost all have come via recommendations from other people to whom I am already linked. It's like being able to walk in a crowded conference room amongst many enlightening and thought-provoking conversations, to listen in, and to be encouraged to contribute where I wish. What a privilege! What I don't understand is why so few people in academia don't appear to take advantage of this? Am I missing something?
