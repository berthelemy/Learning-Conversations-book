# Ideas about using technology to support teacher CPD {#ideas-about-using-technology-to-support-teacher-cpd}

_Date posted: 12 January 2007_

I'm working on a pilot project at the moment, with a group of people responsible for teacher CPD and school development from across England.

We've called it Working in a Blended Learning Environment (WinBLE). It partly involves understanding and applying [what the research says about CPD](http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=159), which seems to suggest that effective CPD:

> *   makes use of peer support
> *   makes explicit use of specialist expertise
> *   makes explicit mention of involving the teachers in applying and refining new knowledge and skills and experimenting with ways of integrating them in their day-to-day practice (six studies involved action research)
> *   involves consultation with the teachers about their own starting points, the focus of the CPD, the pace of the CPD or the scope of the CPD
> *   involves teachers observing one another as an integral part of the CPD
> *   involves specialists in observation and reflection (as part of the CPD rather than exclusively focused on data collection).

Part of the project has also been about how to make best use of the available technologies to ensure the most effective use of time when we apply these approaches to CPD.

As my responsibility has been to facilitate the online components of the project, I've been collecting together ideas from around the world that will be relevant specifically to teacher CPD. You can see these at a Google Reader shared page called [WinBLE-ideas](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/10949212512548432704/label/winble-ideas),

As you'll see, there is a vast amount of thinking going about teaching & learning, and how to support that. The ideas collected so far include (among many others):

> [Jay Cross on John Udell's concept of Cognitive Apprenticeship](http://informl.com/?p=691) where he highlights that the critical social factors to implementing cognitive apprenticeship are: Situated learning. Community of Practice. Intrinsic Motivation. Exploiting Cooperation.
> 
> [John Pederson on how to use Google Docs to support collaborative curriculum planning](http://pedersondesigns.com/2007/01/09/is-this-something-google-curriculum-20/).
> 
> [Ewan McIntosh on developing online communities in Scotland](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/edublogs/~3/72880171/a_few_words_on_.html).
> 
> [Ian Usher on the BucksGfL Learning Platform](http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php/mark/2007/01/08/the_bucksgfl_learning_platform).

> [Ewan McIntosh's podcast about Scotland's approach to using new technologies to support professional development](http://www.berthelemy-family.org.uk/blogs/index.php/mark/2007/01/05/euan_macintosh_on_professional_developme_1).

There are many others, and the list is growing... However the collection does focus a lot on the classroom use of technologies. I'm looking for more examples that are specifically about teacher professional development - especially as they relate to the research above. Any thoughts?
