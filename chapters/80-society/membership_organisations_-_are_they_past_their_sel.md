# Membership organisations - are they past their sell-by date? {#membership-organisations-are-they-past-their-sell-by-date}

_Date posted: 12 November 2011_

@CraigTaylor74 suggested I write this article, following a brief twitter conversation, during which I stated that I was unlikely to join the [ELearning Network](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/) or any other paid-for membership organisation.   What I'm going to say below may be based on a complete misunderstanding of the true situation, so I'd really appreciate any feedback. I'm prepared to have my mind changed!    In the field of learning & development there are a multitude of professional organisations you could join: [ASTD](http://www.astd.org/), [Learning and Performance Institute](http://www.learningandperformanceinstitute.com/), [Elearning Network](http://www.elearningnetwork.org/), [Association for Learning Technology](http://www.alt.ac.uk/), [Chartered Institute for Performance and Development](http://www.cipd.co.uk/), [British Institute for Learning & Development](http://www.thebild.org/).   Pre-Internet, there was definitely a place for such organisations, but I would question their relevance in a world where we can all easily build up professional networks and trusted sources of information.   What do these membership organisations offer in return for your cash?  

*   Access to knowledge and new ideas

*   Recognition of your skills and experience

*   Collective access to senior policy makers(although that is only the stated aim of one or two of the organisations)

  I'll look at each of these in turn:  

### Access to knowledge and new ideas {#access-to-knowledge-and-new-ideas}

  I follow 888 people or organisations on Twitter, and track 413 blogs and other sites via Google Reader. Why do I need to pay to be part of a group of people, when they are already sharing their knowledge quite readily for free?   We're in what is known as a "[gift economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy)", where people give away services for free. The expectation is that, even if you are initially solely a consumer, you may eventually be in a position to give away your knowledge too.   I agree, however, that there is a place for events where you can get direct access to individuals with knowledge. But I don't want to just be on the receiving end of a presentation - I'm looking for conversation. The presentation could have been done in advance through technology. I want to be in a group that is discussing ideas, not just consuming them. These events cost money to run, I know. But they don't have to be expensive - just look at the wave of [Teachmeets](http://www.teachmeet.org.uk/) going across the UK - even now into [teacher training](http://www.oliverquinlan.com/blog/2011/10/28/teachmeet-plymouth-buzzing-about-behaviour/). With a bit of careful sponsorship, they could even be free.    

### Recognition of your skills and experience {#recognition-of-your-skills-and-experience}

  When you're starting off in a career, qualifications are what counts. You've got nothing else to prove that you know what you're about.   As you progress, it's your reputation that becomes more important than your qualifications. I try not to keep track of how many followers I have, or who's reading my blog (given the stats engine on my blog software, that's pretty difficult anyway...), but my gut feel is that, amongst my peers, I've got a reasonable reputation. I hope someone would tell me if otherwise!   The problem comes when your employer, or potential employer, knows nothing about blogs, Twitter et al. And then it becomes a case of pieces of paper, backed up with tales of how well you've done at your previous jobs. That's where my LinkedIn profile comes in handy, as it's where I keep an up-to-date account of my jobs and achievements.   I did go for the [CMALT](http://www.alt.ac.uk/get-involved/certified-membership) (Certified Member of the Association for Learning Technology) qualification, and held that for a year. But I've let my ALT membership lapse now, so can't use those letters after my name any more. Not that it was important though, since, in corporate L&D, very few people really know about ALT anyway.   And that's the problem. There is no real, recognised qualification scheme that I fit into. There's no way I'd go down the CIPD route, as that would push me into HR and generic training manager roles - even though I do small bits of that. Similarly with the Learning & Performance Institute, as their qualifications are all about trainers and facilitators, even though I do some of that too.   For people like me, at the cross-over between IT, L&D and management consultancy, there is no professional body to join. And that's unlikely to change, since we're not a homogenous group of people. We all have different needs and experiences. Just like I don't fit into our competency framework, I'm not going to fit a certification scheme.  

### Collective access to senior policy makers {#collective-access-to-senior-policy-makers}

  To be honest, I think ALT is the only learning technology related organisation that has a need to change public policies - given their roots in Further and Higher Education. If I was working in those sectors, then I'd definitely be an ALT member - mainly for that reason. The equivalent organisation in the primary & secondary sectors is [NAACE](http://www.naace.co.uk/) - which I was also a member of for a while. But, working in the private sector, you feel very removed from government policy. Which is probably why none of the professional bodies seem to be at all worried about lobbying for policy changes. (At least, as far as I can see).   This is where the real strength of a membership organisation can be found. Just like unions, which exist to support each individual member when in need and to promote the needs of the entire membership, there is strength in numbers. It means you have the finances to provide support when needed, and it means people will listen to you.   Our professional membership bodies, however, don't seem to have any form of mutual support built into them (that's not what they're there for), and no clear idea of who needs to listen to them. They just become organisations for sharing ideas - which, as I said earlier - I can get elsewhere.
