# Meme: Random things {#meme-random-things}

Well, this is the first time I've been tagged, and by none less than [Karyn](http://karynromeis.blogspot.com/2007/08/meme-8-random-facts-about-me.html). Like [Harold](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1255), I'm not one for following rules - unless I know and agree with the rationale behind them. So, some facts (true at the point of writing):

1.  "Why?" is my favourite word. It's the way to get to the heart of a client's issues. Unless you know why a client wants what they're asking for, you won't be able to produce a solution that works.
2.  I have worked from home for 3 years. I relish the freedom it brings - to manage my time to meet both work and family commitments. I'm not sure whether I could ever go back to a regime which dictates when I work and what I wear.
3.  As well as working full-time for [Capita Learning & Development](http://www.capita-ld.co.uk/), I also run an independent consultancy company ([Wyver Solutions Ltd](http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/)) which is focussed on the small business, charity & educational sectors.
4.  I took a part-time furniture-making course a few years back. Probably one of the most satisfying learning experiences I've ever had. We still use the coffee table.
5.  I love playing music. It's great when you're playing in a band or an orchestra - everyone knows why they're there and what they're meant to be doing - and you produce music with feeling.

That's enough for now. I'm not going to tag anyone though.![Coffee Table - by Mark](./exportlc.php_files/P8070002-1.JPG "Coffee Table - by Mark")Coffee Table - by Mark
