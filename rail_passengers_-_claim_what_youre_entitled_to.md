# Rail passengers - claim what you're entitled to! {#rail-passengers-claim-what-you-re-entitled-to}

About twice a week at the moment, I'm to be found travelling on [East Midlands Trains](http://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/) between Derby and London. Usually it's a pretty good service, but occasionally things go wrong and my journey gets delayed. That's fine - these things happen. What I can't excuse, though, is the total lack of communication from the train managers about the [compensation that passengers are entitled to](http://www.passengerfocus.org.uk/advice-and-complaints/your-rights/). You can tell that most people don't know, because, at the end of the journey, they're putting their tickets in the gates to get out of the station. Without tickets as evidence, no train operating company (TOC) is going to pay anything. To be honest, [East Midlands Trains "Delay-Repay" policy](http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/passengers-charter1/Delay-Repay/) is pretty generous. But you have to ASK FOR THE CLAIM FORM. No-one will volunteer any information about it. In my experience it's the same with every TOC. They all have a compensation policy, but they won't tell you.
