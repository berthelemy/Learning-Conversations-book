George Siemens writes very clearly on the issues around designing for informal learning. In the comments [Jeroen Spierings](http://jeroen-spierings.blogspot.com/) sets out two things that need to be focussed on:

> 1) We need to focus on learning design instead of instructional design. Today much learning/training/education is still structured and organized top down. Instruction does not work in informal learning. Also focus on the environment and its context rather than on content. The learning content and resources are out there the question is how are we capable of designing an environment where we can connect the learner and the resources just in time. Focus on designing and supporting the environment. I agree with Jay's comments on informal learning content and formal learning support. 2) We need to focus on learner engagement. How do we engage the learner and make sure that he/she is participating. How do we mobilize them which is not an issue related to just informal learning but also is related to formal training and education. Maybe we should focus on emotions in order to solve the above.

I agree with that, partially. I don't think we can remove the need for the central organisation to provide clearly written and structured information. But I do think that the critical thing for any organisation is to encourage a _culture_ of learning that includes sharing and reflection, that is supported and modelled by management, where the organisation's commitment to development is not shown through a collection of training records, but through the learners' contributions to the shared knowledge & practice of the organisation.
