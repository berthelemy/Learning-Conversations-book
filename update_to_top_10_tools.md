# Update to top 10 tools {#update-to-top-10-tools}

_Date posted: 9 January 2008_

I've just updated [my list of Top Ten Tools](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/markberthelemy.html) for [Jane Hart's Centre for Learning & Performance Technologies](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/index.html). It was an interesting exercise, just to see how my work has changed over the past 6 months. The list is now focussed on "learning" tools, rather than any tool that I use for work - so [Kashflow](http://www.kashflow.co.uk/) is out. The CMS has changed, and so has the screen capture tool. Not because there's anything wrong with the others, but because Joomla & Jing are a better fit for what I currently do. I've also moved away from MindManager for the moment, to using CmapTools more. Mainly because I find it fits my thought processes better. So, here's the full current list:

1.  [Firefox](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/firefox.html). (Open source).  This remains at the top spot. In fact, it's such a central part of my daily learning (both consuming and creating) that I almost put it at the same level as my broadband connection - essential. What's special about it over other browsers? It was the first tabbed browser I used, which completely changed the way I use the web. It's got hundreds of add-ons, including the indispensible web-developer toolbar, Colorzilla (for easily matching colours), Scrapbook (for quickly taking snapshots of webpages for annotating later) and QuickProxy (which, with one click, lets you switch your proxy server on & off).
2.  [Jing](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/jing.html). (Closed source, but free).I'm finding I'm using this more and more. It's similar to Wink, Captivate and Snagit. However, where these are great for producing finished, polished products, Jing just sits there for when it's needed and works quickly. It's ideal for producing "disposable learning objects" (not my term, but it's starting to appear more frequently). If I need to show someone how a software function works, I capture it (either as a single image or a movie - with narration, then can choose whether to publish it to TechSmith's Screencast.com site, to my own ftp site, or to a file. It's simple. It's easy to use. And my clients think it's great.
3.  [Google Web Search](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/google.html). (Free to use). I know other search engines are available. But I can work Google. I know how to make it produce meaningful results. 95% of the time it does what I need. So why change? Without search, the wealth of information on the web would be like a library with no index: impossible to use effectively. With it, I know that I can learn almost anything **when I need to**.
4.  [Google Desktop Search](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googledesktop.html). (Closed source, but free).  Just as I rely on Google web search almost more than my bookmarks, I rely on their desktop search engine to be able to find files and emails rather than wade through layers of folders. It's not infallible - being particularly frustrating when it displays part of an email, but then Outlook can't open it because it's been moved. But this is more than mitigated by the number of times its found a document that I couldn't see anywhere in my file structure.
5.  [Moodle](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/moodle.html). (Open source).I've been working with Moodle for four years - since version 1 came out. Although designed to work within a formal education setting, its beauty is in its flexibility. Every organisation, and every person, will use Moodle in a different way. It's would be a particularly mature learning organisation which uses every function of Moodle. Now that we've cracked the way the Moodle theme packs work, we're finding more and more applications for it - particularly in public sector organisations. There are two things that Moodle does not do well. One is handling bookings for face-to-face events, so some sort of Learner records system is an essential component of a complete solution. The other is handling content for use outside of a formal "course"-based delivery. See 6.
6.  [Joomla](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/joomla.html). (Open source).   Any organisation that wishes to support learners at their point of need, as well as during formal "courses" needs an effective content management system. It needs to be searchable. It needs to allow administrators (and even users) to add content easily. And it needs to be flexible in terms of appearance and navigation. There are many content management systems out there. The commercial ones are tending to aim at high-end usage; with multi-format publishing, workflows, faceted search etc. For many applications, the range of open source solutions is more than adequate. Each one has its particular strengths; some have highly comprehensive configuration interfaces, some are better for bespoking, some provide immediately usable out-of-the-box solutions. But I had to choose one for this list. Joomla appears to have a strong development team. The modules available, both in the standard package, and as add-ons, are incredibly powerful. It does require careful configuration, and good support, as a complex site can become complex to change. At the moment, though, this is tending to be top of my list for content management.
7.  [Articulate Engage](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/articulate.html). (Commercial).   Along with its big brother, Articulate Presenter, Engage is rapidly becoming a key part of my content development strategy. With Engage, I can quickly produce good-looking Flash-based materials with embedded media navigated using one of a set of pre-defined interfaces. These interfaces include (among others) a timeline, concentric rings, image hotspots, pyramids with layers and FAQs. Yes, you are limited to the interfaces available. But they pretty much cover most situations. I use Engage when I need to deliver something that looks good and covers a small amount of content. As a component part of a content strategy it's ideal.
8.  [Google Reader](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/googlereader.html). (Free to use). Keeping up-to-date is a rapidly changing field, and knowing what the market is saying about learning, about technology, and about us is critical for success. An RSS reader allows me to do that without having to go to dozens of websites to see if they've got anything new. Google Reader has been my reader of choice for a year now. I can use it from any internet-connected browser. I can organise things just how I want. I can even share particular items, or whole groups of items, with other people in many different ways. I like the way it allows me to choose how I use it - its flexibility.
9.  [b2evolution](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/b2evolution.html). (Open source). I use my blog to reflect on what I'm learning, to add to the conversation about particular topics, and to store ideas and materials that I want to remember. It's an essential part of my personal knowledge management system. I chose to host it on my own webspace as then I control the data within it. It's too important to be left to a free service. And I don't need to pay someone to host it. I chose b2evolution for its flexibility. It's a multi-user, multi-blog system. Very similar to WordpressMU but far easier to install and configure.
10.  [CmapTools](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/Top100Tools/cmap.html). (Free to certain groups). When I've got some complex ideas to sort out and simplify, I quite often turn to CmapTools. This is a concept mapping tool that allows any concept to link to any other concept, along with linking phrases. Very quickly, a map can become too complex. But then that forces a thought process to simplify it down to its essentials. I often go through that process when preparing presentations or learning materials. It makes sure you only include detail that is relevant
