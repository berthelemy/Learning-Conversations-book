# Being Creative in a Digital World - follow up 2 {#being-creative-in-a-digital-world-follow-up-2}

_Date posted: 24 March 2011_

I had the privilege of running another "Being Creative in a Digital World" online workshop this morning. Like [last time](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/12/02/being-creative-in-a-digital-world-follow-up?blog=5), we used Webex, and again followed (roughly!) the [structure outlined here](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/11/01/being-creative-in-digital-world?blog=5). The conversation ranged widely - with only four people it meant there was a fair bit of scope for discussion. We discussed how, when working in the social media space, having an authentic voice is absolutely critical. I recommended reading the [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/) (free download), as it really opens up how organisations should connect with their markets. We considered how to get the best out of tools like Twitter, Yammer and Socialcast. As I wrote in my [Best Practice Guide to Yammer](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2010/04/29/yammer-best-practice-guide-yam?blog=5):

> You walk into a conference room. It's your first time at this particular conference and there's no welcome pack. You can see quite a few people standing around drinking coffee and eating small pastries. But no-one's talking to each other. You have three options:
> 
> *   Turn around and walk out.
> *   Find someone you know and begin a conversation about one of the conference themes.
> *   Introduce yourself to someone you don't know and look for areas of common interest
> 
> Social media tools can sometimes feel like that conference room. For many people it's a strange new environment. There are no clear rules on how to behave or what to do. We know the value of networking, but doing that online can be daunting at times.

We also looked at how [RSS feeds](http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english) can make it a lot easier to keep up to date, maintain your connections with your information sources, to filter out what you don't need to see and to share what you've learnt. (See [Harold Jarche's guide to Personal Knowledge Management](http://www.jarche.com/2010/03/pkm-in-a-nutshell/)). The key thing is to find your trusted sources, and the best way to do that is through personal recommendation, but also to seek out those sources who do not necessarily agree with your own point of view. We then went on to think about how the tools at our disposal encourage creativity across organisational and even national boundaries. The first couple of minutes of [Chris Anderson's talk at TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation.html) really highlights this in the context of dance - through Youtube kids are sharing moves and building on what they're learning. We looked at tools that are making it easier to share content:

*   Content creation tools like the [Flip camera](http://www.theflip.com/), [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), [PiratePad](http://piratepad.net/) (collaborative writing)
*   Content sharing tools like [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.com/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/) (where quality seems to be more the norm than [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/)), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) (for images)
*   Mind-mapping/brainstorming tools like [Mindmeister](http://www.mindmeister.com/), [Personal Brain](http://www.thebrain.com/), [CmapTools](http://cmap.ihmc.us/), [Bubbl.us](http://bubbl.us/) and [Text2MindMap](http://www.text2mindmap.com/)
*   Knowledge aggregation tools like [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/), [Addictomatic](http://addictomatic.com/)
*   Productivity tools like [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com/) (for meeting scheduling) and [YouSendIt](http://www.yousendit.com/) (for moving large files around), [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) (for seeing how people are using your stuff)

More tools in the extensive list on [Jane Hart's directory](http://c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/index.html) - [summarised beautifully in this PDF](http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/articles/30ways.pdf) We made the point that free tools might not necessarily be appropriate for large-scale use. You need to understand the business model as well as the risks of putting your data on servers you know nothing about. Finally, one of the delegates highlighted an example of a truly collaborative and creative project, the [Johnny Cash Project](http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/) As with all these sorts of workshops there's no real end result, other than an increased awareness of what is possible. It's then up to the individuals to then go work out what will work for them, in their context.
