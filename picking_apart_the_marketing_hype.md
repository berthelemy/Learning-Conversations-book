# Picking apart the marketing hype {#picking-apart-the-marketing-hype}

In a recent advert for a forthcoming tradeshow, I read:

> "... the most cost-effective way to keep yourself up-to-speed with the rapidly changing world of organisational learning and learning technology."

Well, apart from the fact that most of what is on show at these exhibitions hasn't changed significantly in years (as compared to the cutting edge of what's happening in learning technology), I disagree that going to an exhibition is the "most cost-effective way to keep yourself up-to-speed".

A better way by far is to use a **free** RSS reader (like [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)), and subscribe to a handful of blogs in your field of interest (also free).

The only cost then is your time - which, at a few minutes a day, is probably more easy to manage than taking a day or two our to visit the exhibition.

Suffice to say, I probably won't be there, unless someone asks me to help on their stand ;-)

[UPDATE: OK, so I've given in! I will be there, but mainly because it's the quickest way to get around people I need to talk to...]
