# The LMS must die {#the-lms-must-die}

_Date posted: 15 August 2010_

The LMS (or Learning Management System) has been around for a while now. They are usually deployed into large organisations who need to be able to deploy lots of learning materials to lots of people, whilst controlling access, and recording use. The typical corporate learning management system (see note below) contains a catalogue of learning materials, sometimes tailored to specific roles. These materials are in the form of SCORM content packages (see [SCORM Warning](http://www.learningconversations.co.uk/main/index.php/2008/08/08/scorm-warning?blog=5) for more information on SCORM). So, what does the LMS offer to businesses?

1.  A single repository for learning materials
2.  A place where learning materials are mapped to roles
3.  Automation of training interventions, eg. you must pass by a certain date
4.  A means of tracking which materials have been used and "passed", by whom

And what does it offer to learners?

1.  A single place to go to for learning materials
2.  All the learning materials for my role
3.  Automated reminders of what I need to do for my job
4.  A consolidated record of the learning interventions I have undertaken

At least, that's the theory. Seeing how people really use the internet to support their learning, let's look at it another way. You could analyse learning needs like this:

|   | **The organisation knows the answers** | **The organisation doesn't know the answers** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The learner knows the answers** | No need for learning | The learner should share the answers with the organisation - eg. blogs, enterprise micro-blogging, wikis, internal Youtube etc |
| **The learner knows they don't know the answers** | Use an internal search engine to find the organisation's view on things | Ask questions on an internal forum / social networking site to see which colleagues know the answers |
| **The learner doesn't know they don't know the answers** | The learner needs to be directed towards the answers. There is a case here for the LMS (eg. compliance, induction, process changes etc), but supported by effective internal communication, and searchable reference material. | The organisation needs to hope that someone near the learner will be able to help! |

There is only one space in this analysis (highlighted) where an LMS might be vaguely applicable. Yet that accounts for most of the investment in learning within our organisations. Most people, when they know they need to learn something, start with a search engine. Usually that search engine already knows quite a bit about the individual, and can immediately make recommendations about what they should be looking at. So, how about a system that knows your role, makes recommendations on current induction and compliance materials, and then lets you find the rest of the stuff you need? The trouble with that approach, is that anything that is locked inside a SCORM wrapper is stuck inside a SCORM wrapper. No search engine will ever be able to find it. And, even if it could, wouldn't be able to link to a specific page inside it. (That's one of the warnings I missed out on my SCORM Warnings post!) This means that, however good the content is, your learners will be unlikely ever to a) find it again, or b) use it to refer to. They are reliant on the LMS provoking them to revisit the materials, rather than their own need or curiosity. So, it turns out, that it's the LMS (+SCORM) that is blocking learning. As an example, I know at least one government agency where employees learn about internal processes through Google searches that lead to client-facing materials, rather than through their internal learning materials which are inside the LMS! All the time we have LMS's, organisations will feel bound to continue to put content inside it that should, instead be sitting elsewhere, in a searchable (and thus findable) state. So, my call is for organisations to think more strategically about their learning materials. Consider where they should be best placed for most effective long term gain, and perhaps even closing the LMS to new materials...

### Note {#note}

Corporate learning management systems differ hugely from academic learning management systems (aka virtual learning environment: VLE). Generally, the academic system is based around courses, tutors and discussion, and less around content. However, too many tutors simply use their system as a means of distributing content... but that's another post...
