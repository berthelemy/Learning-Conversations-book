### Credits {#credits}

Thanks to [Clive Shepherd](http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-case-you-missed-it-year-in-posts.html) for the idea of looking back in this way. Thanks to all those people who have engaged in conversation whether face to face or online. It's that process of asking and answering questions that helps to refine my thinking.
